//! Which of *your* files ran this statement.
//!
//! # Why this is a stack walk and not the tracing registry
//!
//! Everywhere else the profiler reads what the application already emits
//! (`docs/adr/0004-development-profiler.md`, section 4). This is the one thing
//! that route cannot answer. A statement is logged by sqlx, so the event's own
//! metadata points at `sqlx-core/src/logger.rs` on every row, and the span
//! stack around it is one frame - `http` - because the application opens no
//! spans of its own. `#[instrument]` appears nowhere in the workspace, and
//! adding it to the hundreds of functions that touch a database to make a
//! development tool work is exactly the rot section 4 rejects.
//!
//! So the stack is walked directly. The frames are real: an `.await`ed future
//! is polled from its caller's poll, so the chain from the axum handler down to
//! the query is on the stack when sqlx logs it.
//!
//! # What it costs, and when
//!
//! Split deliberately in two.
//!
//! * **On the request:** a stack walk that records instruction pointers and
//!   nothing else. No symbol lookup, no allocation per frame beyond one `Vec`,
//!   no file system access. Measured at **756 ns** a capture on the machine
//!   this was written on, so a screen running forty statements pays about
//!   thirty microseconds for the whole panel.
//! * **When somebody opens the report:** the addresses are turned into
//!   function names and file positions. Symbolication is the expensive half by
//!   two orders of magnitude, and it is paid once, by a human who is waiting
//!   for a page they asked for.
//!
//! Resolving later is sound because a profile never outlives the process that
//! recorded it - the ring is in memory and dies with the binary the addresses
//! point into.
