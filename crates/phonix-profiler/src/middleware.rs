//! The two layers that turn one request into one profile, and why they are
//! two.
//!
//! # The requirement that does not fit in one middleware
//!
//! A profile needs two things that live at opposite ends of the stack.
//!
//! * **The tenant, and the queries that resolved it.** `resolve_tenant` runs
//!   as a `Router::layer`, so it has finished before routing begins. Its
//!   `Span::record("tenant", ..)` and its `SELECT .. FROM tenants` both happen
//!   there. A collector established after it sees neither - the profile says
//!   `tenant: none` on a request that resolved one perfectly well, and its
//!   query list is missing the statement it ran.
//! * **The route pattern.** [`MatchedPath`] is inserted *during* routing, so
//!   nothing wrapping the router can read it. A middleware outside routing
//!   gives every profile a URL and no route, which is most of what a profile
//!   exists to say.
//!
//! No single middleware can be in both places, so there are two:
//!
//! | | attached with | does |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`collect`] | `Router::layer`, inside `TraceLayer` and outside `resolve_tenant` | opens the collector, times, files the profile |
//! | [`route`] | `Router::route_layer` | writes [`MatchedPath`] into the collector |
//!
//! Both run on the same task, which is what lets the inner one write into a
//! task-local the outer one opened.
//!
//! A request that matches no route still gets a profile - [`collect`] wraps
//! routing - and it has no route pattern, which is the honest answer rather
//! than a missing row. That is a change from the arrangement this replaces,
//! where a 404 was not profiled at all.
