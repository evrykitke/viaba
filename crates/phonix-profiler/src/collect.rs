//! How events reach the request that caused them.
//!
//! The mechanism is a task-local: the middleware wraps the whole downstream
//! future in [`CURRENT`], and a `tracing` layer appends every event it sees to
//! whatever is in there. Nothing else is instrumented, and nothing has to know
//! the profiler exists.
//!
//! # Why a task-local and not the span registry
//!
//! The registry can be asked which span an event is inside, and a collector
//! could be hung off that span's extensions. That is the more thorough
//! mechanism and it costs a subscriber downcast through `WithContext` to reach
//! it from the middleware. A task-local needs none of that and gets the same
//! answer for the case that matters, because a request is one task.
//!
//! What it gives up, stated so it is not rediscovered as a bug: **work that
//! leaves the request's task is not collected.** A `tokio::spawn` inside a
//! handler, and the connection pool's own background work, emit their events
//! outside this scope. That is the right answer for a request profiler - those
//! events did not belong to the request - but it does mean the query list is
//! what this request ran, not everything the process ran while it waited.
