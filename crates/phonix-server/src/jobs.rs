//! The background work: verifying uploads, publishing events, sweeping up.
//!
//! Three loops, all of them the same shape - wake up, walk the active tenants,
//! do a bounded amount of work in each, sleep - and all three cancellable, so a
//! shutdown drains rather than severs.
//!
//! | Loop        | What it does                                              |
//! | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | verifier    | Claims received uploads and turns them into stored files   |
//! | relay       | Publishes outbox rows to RabbitMQ and marks them sent      |
//! | sweeper     | Removes quarantined bytes whose job never ran              |
//!
//! # Why the verifier polls at all
//!
//! It mostly does not. An upload is dispatched the moment its bytes are down -
//! see `files::dispatch` - so the usual path is immediate and the poll finds
//! nothing. The loop exists for the case the fast path cannot cover: a process
//! that died between writing the row and running the job. Without it those rows
//! sit at `received` for ever, and the symptom is one user whose file never
//! finished while everybody else's worked.
//!
//! That is also why the interval is measured in seconds rather than
//! milliseconds. It is a safety net, not a queue.
//!
//! # Why each loop walks every tenant
//!
//! There is one database per tenant, so there is one queue per tenant, and
//! nothing in Postgres can wait on two databases at once. A `LISTEN`-based
//! design would need a connection per tenant held open permanently, which is
//! the thing the pool registry exists to avoid. Polling a handful of indexed
//! partial indexes is cheap; holding a thousand connections is not.
