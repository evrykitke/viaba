//! `POST /files/upload` and `GET /files/{id}/content`.
//!
//! Plain axum handlers rather than server functions, and for two different
//! reasons.
//!
//! **Uploading** is a multipart body that has to be *streamed*. A server
//! function takes its argument deserialised, which means the whole file in
//! memory before any code of ours runs - and the byte ceiling would then be
//! something we check after paying for it. Here the field is read chunk by
//! chunk straight into storage, and the ceiling is enforced by the writer as
//! the bytes arrive.
//!
//! **Downloading** is a response whose body is the file: a content type, a
//! disposition header and a stream. There is nothing for Leptos to render.
//!
//! # These routes carry their own limits
//!
//! The application's global body limit is 2 MiB, which is right for a form post
//! and would refuse every upload. So this router sets its own - the configured
//! `storage.max_upload_bytes` - and its own timeout, because 25 MB does not
//! arrive inside the clock a page render is judged by. `startup` merges it
//! *after* the global layers precisely so that those do not apply here.
//!
//! # What the download route will not do
//!
//! * It never serves the `Content-Type` the uploader declared - only the one
//!   detection decided on.
//! * It never renders anything inline except a picture that cannot carry a
//!   script, and it says so with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a CSP
//!   that permits nothing at all.
//! * It never reads from quarantine. That is enforced in the service layer, so
//!   it is true of every caller and not only of this one.
//!
//! # And why `GET /files/{id}/preview` exists beside it
//!
//! A preview pane needs the same bytes with the opposite disposition: `inline`,
//! so a frame renders them rather than starting a download. That is a different
//! promise, so it is a different address rather than a query parameter - a
//! route that will only answer for the handful of types this application can
//! render, and answers `415` for everything else.
//!
//! **The PDF question.** A PDF is active content: it has a JavaScript engine
//! and an `/OpenAction` that fires on open, which is why the download route
//! refuses to render one. It is also the commonest attachment there is, and a
//! purchase ledger where every supplier invoice must be downloaded to be read
//! is a purchase ledger nobody uses. So the preview route serves it with
//! `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts`, and the two words matter
//! in opposite directions:
//!
//! * `sandbox` puts the response in an **opaque origin**. Whatever the document
//!   manages to run cannot read this origin's cookies, storage or DOM, cannot
//!   call the API as the signed-in user, and cannot navigate the top window.
//! * `allow-scripts` is there because the viewer doing the rendering is itself
//!   a scripted document - `pdf.js` in Firefox, the built-in viewer in Chrome -
//!   and without it the frame renders nothing at all.
//!
//! Notably absent is `allow-same-origin`, which is the one that would undo the
//! first bullet. A picture gets the stricter form with no `allow-scripts` at
//! all, because nothing has to run to draw one.
