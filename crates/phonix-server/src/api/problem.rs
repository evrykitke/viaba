//! What `/api/v1` answers when something goes wrong.
//!
//! RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`, rather than an envelope of our own: it
//! is the one error format an HTTP client library might already understand, and
//! the field names are not worth arguing about.
//!
//! # `code` is the contract, and it is not a translation key
//!
//! Every user-facing string in Evrykit is a `Message` key resolved by the view.
//! That is right for a browser and wrong here: a key labels a *sentence*, the
//! sentence is translated, and neither is a stable thing for a script to branch
//! on. So the machine-readable half is [`phonix_core::Error::code`] - which
//! already exists, is already coarse, and already has a test tying it to a
//! status.
//!
//! `title` and `detail` are for a person reading a log. They are English, they
//! are not a contract, and they may be reworded in any release.
//!
//! # Nothing sensitive can reach here
//!
//! Not by care taken in this module, but by the conversion it goes through:
//! `ServiceError -> Error` logs the cause server-side and replaces it with a
//! coarse label, so a connection string, a constraint name or a key
//! description cannot cross. That is also why no handler in this module
//! matches on `ServiceError` directly - the only exception is a field
//! rejection, which contains nothing but what the caller submitted.
