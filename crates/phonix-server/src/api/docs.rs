//! The page at `/api/v1/docs`, and why it is not the one the crate ships.
//!
//! `utoipa-scalar`'s default template loads `@scalar/api-reference` from
//! jsdelivr with no version in the URL. That is a page which is blank without
//! internet, and which executes whatever that CDN answers with today inside
//! our own origin - on the one page a customer's developer reads *before* they
//! decide to trust us. So the bundle is vendored into `public/` by
//! `node tools/vendor-scalar.mjs` and served from the site root, exactly as the
//! editor bundle is; see [`super::scalar_bundle`].
//!
//! Nothing else about the template changes. The `$spec` placeholder is what
//! `Scalar::to_html` substitutes the serialised document into, so it has to
//! survive verbatim.
