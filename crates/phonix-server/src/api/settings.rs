//! `/api/v1/settings` - what a workspace has decided about itself.
//!
//! The administration area's settings screen is four tabs, and this is those
//! four tabs. They are **four sub-resources rather than one document**, and
//! that is the one design decision here worth stating:
//!
//! ```text
//! /settings/security      the password, MFA and audit policies   read: ungated
//! /settings/organization  who the workspace legally is           read: Settings
//! /settings/mail          this workspace's own relay             read: Settings
//! /settings/api           whether the API-key surface is sold    read: ungated
//! ```
//!
//! Merging them would force the strictest gate onto the loosest part. The
//! password policy is deliberately readable by everybody - a person filling in
//! a change-password form needs to be told the rules - and folding it into a
//! document that also carries the organization's registered address would mean
//! only administrators could find out how long their password has to be.
//!
//! # The gate is the service's, never this file's
//!
//! Every handler below calls its use case and lets `Caller::require` inside it
//! answer. Where a read is ungated here it is because the *service* is ungated,
//! for a reason recorded next to it. ADR 0002 §"Consequences": a use case that
//! authorizes in its adapter is a bug, because the other adapter will not do
//! it - and the inverse is just as true. An adapter that adds a gate the
//! service does not have is a surface that refuses what the browser allows,
//! and nothing would ever report the difference.
//!
//! # A PUT is the whole document
//!
//! Every field is required on the way in. Defaulting an omitted `enabled` to
//! `false` would let a caller who sent half a policy switch the audit trail off
//! without ever naming it, and "I did not mention it" must not mean "turn it
//! off". A client changing one field reads, edits and writes back - which is
//! also what makes two administrators saving at once produce one of the two
//! documents rather than a mixture of both.
