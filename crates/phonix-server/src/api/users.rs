//! `/api/v1/users` - the people with an account on this workspace.
//!
//! Currencies proved the machinery; this proves the two things it could not.
//! Its read is **gated**, on `Pages.Administration.Users`, where the currency
//! list is ungated - so a key with no scopes gets a 403 here and a 200 there,
//! which is the scope intersection working rather than merely compiling. And
//! it is addressed by a UUID rather than by a code the caller already knows,
//! so a client has to have read the list to reach a row.
//!
//! # The writes, and the escalation question they had to answer
//!
//! ADR 0002 held these back with a stated worry: roles and status move
//! together, and *a key must not be able to hand itself a role*. Two things
//! answer it, and neither is new machinery:
//!
//! * **Changing roles requires `Users.ChangePermissions`**, asked for by the
//!   service only when the roles actually differ - so renaming somebody needs
//!   `Users.Edit` alone. A key can only carry that permission if its owner
//!   holds it, and its owner holding it means they can already do this in a
//!   browser.
//! * **A key cannot widen itself.** Its power is its owner's current grants
//!   intersected with its own scopes, re-read on every request. Granting its
//!   owner more changes the first half and not the second, so the key it was
//!   presented with reaches no further than it did a moment ago.
//!
//! What is left is that somebody with `Users.ChangePermissions` can escalate
//! *themselves*, which has always been true of that permission and is what it
//! means. It is not a property of this surface, and refusing here would only
//! mean the browser and the API disagree about who may administer a workspace.
//!
//! Four writes, three different gates:
//!
//! ```text
//! POST /users                     Users.Create  (+ChangePermissions with roles)
//! POST /users/{id}/invitation     Users.Create
//! PUT  /users/{id}                Users.Edit    (+ChangePermissions if roles move)
//! PUT  /users/{id}/permissions    Users.ChangePermissions
//! ```
//!
//! # What is deliberately still not here
//!
//! Setting somebody's password. An account gets one exactly once, from the
//! person who will use it, by opening an invitation link - see
//! `invitation::accept`. An endpoint that set one for somebody else would be
//! an account takeover with a friendly name, and there is no client that needs
//! it.
//!
//! # Why this pages in memory
//!
//! `directory::list` is unpaged, and its own doc comment says that is
//! deliberate: the workspace that needs server-side paging needs a cursor and
//! a server-side search designed together, and neither should be guessed at.
//! This handler is not the place to force that decision - a public endpoint
//! quietly growing a second, different paging story for the same rows the
//! screen shows is how the two drift apart. It reads what the screen reads and
//! cuts the page here; when the service grows a `PageRequest`, this passes it
//! down and nothing on the wire changes.
