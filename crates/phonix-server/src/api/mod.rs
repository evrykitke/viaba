//! `/api/v1` - the documented, versioned surface.
//!
//! Not to be confused with the server functions, which also live under `/api`.
//! Those are this browser talking to its own server: unversioned, undocumented,
//! and free to change the day the screen above them changes. **This** is what a
//! mobile app, a customer's script and anything else outside the building talk
//! to, and none of them can be redeployed the afternoon we rename a field.
//!
//! See `docs/adr/0002-public-api.md`. The four decisions this module exists to
//! enforce:
//!
//! * **It calls `phonix-services` directly.** The same use cases the server
//!   functions call, with the same `Caller::require` inside them. Wrapping the
//!   server functions would have coupled a published surface to
//!   `ServerFnError` and to cookie authentication.
//! * **The wire types live here.** `CurrencyResource` is not `CurrencyRow`.
//!   The hand-written conversion is what makes an internal rename a compile
//!   error instead of a silent breaking change to a payload somebody's phone
//!   depends on.
//! * **Errors are RFC 9457 problem documents**, with a machine code that is not
//!   a translation key. See [`problem`].
//! * **Additive only.** Inside `v1`: new endpoints, new optional request
//!   fields, new response fields. Anything else is `v2`.
//!
//! # Why this is nested rather than merged
//!
//! [`Router::nest`] keeps this router's own fallback, so an unknown
//! `/api/v1/...` path answers a problem document rather than the application's
//! Leptos error page - which no client can parse. `merge` cannot: two
//! fallbacks in one router is a panic at startup.
