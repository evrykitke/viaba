//! `/api/v1/auth` - signing a person in from a device that has no cookie jar.
//!
//! See `docs/adr/0003-mobile-authentication.md`. The whole design in one line:
//! **a mobile sign-in produces a session, not a new kind of credential.** The
//! same row in `sessions`, the same two deadlines, the same `revoked_at`, the
//! same `mfa_satisfied`; the token comes back in a JSON body instead of a
//! `Set-Cookie` header, and it lives by `[security.session.mobile]`.
//!
//! Nothing here re-implements a sign-in. `authentication::sign_in` is called
//! with [`Delivery::Bearer`] and reaches the lockout check, the
//! timing-equalised dummy verify, the audit entry and every `LoginResult`
//! outcome by exactly the code a browser reaches them by. A second sign-in path
//! is a second place for a control to be forgotten, and there is not one.
//!
//! # Four endpoints, and the fifth that is missing
//!
//! There is no refresh endpoint. The session slides on use - `session::resume`
//! already does that - so an application opened inside the idle window never
//! needs one, and one that is not needs a real sign-in. A refresh/access pair
//! exists to bound the damage of a long-lived credential on a server that
//! cannot revoke; this one can, in a single statement.
