//! What one anonymous caller may ask for, and how often.
//!
//! Everything the public screens do runs before anybody has said who they are.
//! Signing in spends an Argon2 verification that is *deliberately* slow - 200
//! to 500 ms on the production box, by `[security.password]`. Asking for a
//! password reset opens an SMTP conversation. Creating a workspace creates a
//! Postgres database, runs its migrations, writes a permission tree and
//! inserts a catalog row.
//!
//! None of those asks who is calling first, so this does.
//!
//! # The key is the whole design
//!
//! A rate limiter keyed on something the caller controls is not a rate limiter.
//! Send a different value each time and each request arrives as a brand new
//! client with a brand new allowance - the counting still happens, it simply
//! never counts the same thing twice.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical here. The audit-trail code reads the **first**
//! entry of `X-Forwarded-For`, and nginx is configured with
//! `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, which *appends* the real address to whatever
//! the client sent. So `X-Forwarded-For: <anything>` puts an attacker-chosen
//! value in first place on every request. Good enough for a log line a person
//! reads with judgement; useless as a key.
//!
//! So this reads exactly one source, named by
//! `security.rate_limit.client_ip_header`, and nothing else. Empty means the
//! peer address of the TCP connection - unforgeable, and correct whenever this
//! process is reachable directly. A header is right only when every request has
//! passed through something that overwrites it. See `config/base.toml`.
//!
//! # Fixed windows, in memory
//!
//! The counting itself is [`phonix_limit`], because the public site limits
//! anonymous traffic too and a second implementation of it would drift. What
//! stays here is the part that is about *this* application: which requests are
//! counted at all, what each of them is keyed on, and how much each tier gets.
