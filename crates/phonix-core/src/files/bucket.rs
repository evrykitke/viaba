//! What a file is *for*, and what that permits.
//!
//! A bucket is the answer to "why is this being uploaded" - an avatar, an
//! attachment, a spreadsheet to import. It is not a folder, although it becomes
//! one on disk; it is a policy, and the folder falls out of it.
//!
//! Declared in code, like the permission tree and for the same reason: the code
//! is what enforces it. A limit in a configuration file is a limit an operator
//! can raise past what the rest of the system can survive, and a bucket nothing
//! checks is a directory anyone can fill.
//!
//! ```text
//!   avatars       2 MB   pictures only, nothing scriptable   anyone signed in
//!   logos         2 MB   pictures only, nothing scriptable   Settings
//!   attachments  25 MB   documents, pictures, archives       Files.Upload
//!   imports      10 MB   text and tabular data only          Files.Upload
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the limit lives here rather than in `[storage]`
//!
//! Both, in fact. The configuration carries one hard ceiling for the whole
//! server - the number the HTTP layer refuses past, before any of this is
//! consulted - and each bucket carries the smaller number that is right for
//! what it holds. A 25 MB attachment is reasonable; a 25 MB avatar is somebody
//! filling the disk one profile picture at a time, and the difference is a
//! property of the bucket, not of the deployment.
