//! An upload, from the moment the bytes land to the event that says what
//! became of them.
//!
//! # An upload is a job, so it has states rather than a return value
//!
//! The request that carries the bytes does not decide anything. It writes them
//! to a quarantine area, records a row, and answers with an id - and that is
//! all it does, because everything worth doing to an uploaded file is work that
//! must survive the connection dropping halfway through. Deciding what the file
//! is, hashing it, moving it into place, and one day scanning it, all happen in
//! a worker afterwards.
//!
//! ```text
//!   received ──► verifying ──► stored      the file is real and in place
//!                    │
//!                    ├───────► rejected    the file is not acceptable
//!                    └───────► failed      we could not finish the work
//! ```
//!
//! `rejected` and `failed` are deliberately different terminal states. A
//! rejection is an answer about the file - it is too big, or it is not what it
//! said it was - and repeating the upload unchanged will produce it again. A
//! failure is about us: the disk was full, the storage backend was unreachable.
//! Collapsing the two would tell somebody to fix their file when the problem
//! was ours.
//!
//! # What comes back
//!
//! [`UploadResult`] is the event, published as
//! `tenant.<slug>.file.upload.completed` when the job reaches any terminal
//! state. It carries the whole outcome, so a consumer never has to read the
//! database to know what happened. [`FileSummary`] is the narrower view a
//! screen renders - the same facts minus the ones a browser has no use for.
