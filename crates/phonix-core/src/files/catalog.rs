//! What a file *is*, decided from its bytes.
//!
//! The catalogue below is the single list of types this application will store,
//! and it is declared in code for the same reason the permission tree is: the
//! code is what enforces it. A type nobody listed here cannot be uploaded, and
//! adding one is a code change that a reviewer sees.
//!
//! # The extension is a claim, not evidence
//!
//! A browser sends two things about a file it is uploading: the name the user
//! chose, and a MIME type the *operating system* guessed from that name. Both
//! are attacker-controlled - `payload.exe` renamed to `holiday.png` arrives
//! declaring `image/png`, because that is what Windows says a `.png` is. So
//! neither decides anything here. [`detect`] reads the leading bytes and
//! answers from those; the declared name and type are kept only so a rejection
//! can say what the caller *claimed*, and so a download can offer the original
//! name back.
//!
//! # Where a signature is not enough
//!
//! Two families of format are containers that many types share, and their
//! leading bytes say only which container:
//!
//! * **Zip** - every OOXML document (`.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`) and every ODF
//!   one is a zip archive, and so is a zip archive.
//! * **CFB** - Microsoft's pre-2007 compound file, shared by `.doc`, `.xls`,
//!   `.ppt` and Outlook's `.msg`.
//!
//! For those, detection finds the container and then reads a little further for
//! the marker the specific format puts near the front. When that fails the
//! answer is the container itself, which is a real type with real rules - not a
//! guess dressed up as a document.
//!
//! # And where there are no bytes to read at all
//!
//! Plain text, CSV and JSON have no signature; there is nothing to look at
//! except the content. [`looks_like_text`] is what stands in for a signature
//! there: valid UTF-8 with no control bytes other than tab, carriage return and
//! newline. That is a genuine test - a PE header or an ELF header fails it on
//! the first byte - and it is the only reason a `.csv` can be accepted at all.
