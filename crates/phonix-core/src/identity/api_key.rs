//! What a screen says about an API key, and what it sends to make one.
//!
//! The credential itself lives in `phonix-services`; nothing here can produce
//! or verify a token. These are the three shapes that cross the wire:
//!
//! * [`ApiKeyDraft`] - what a form fills in.
//! * [`ApiKeySummary`] - what a list draws. Carries the *hint*, never the key.
//! * [`ApiKeyIssued`] - the one moment the token exists outside the client that
//!   will hold it.
//!
//! # Scopes are permission names, and this type does not check them
//!
//! A draft carries names from the compiled tree -
//! `Pages.Administration.Settings` - and [`ApiKeyDraft::validate`] deliberately
//! does not ask whether they are real or whether the issuer holds them. The
//! first is a question for `authorization::is_defined` and the second only the
//! service can answer, because it is about the person asking rather than about
//! the draft. What is checked here is what a form can check without a server:
//! that the key has a name, and that an expiry is in the future.
