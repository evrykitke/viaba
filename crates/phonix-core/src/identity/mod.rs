//! Identity: accounts, credentials and the forms that create them.
//!
//! Everything here compiles to wasm, which is the point: the signup form runs
//! exactly the rules the server enforces, so the client cannot show a green
//! field that the server will later reject. The server never *trusts* this -
//! it re-runs every check - but the two can no longer drift.
//!
//! What deliberately does **not** live here:
//!
//! * password hashing, session tokens, anything touching a database - those are
//!   in `phonix_db::identity`;
//! * permissions and roles - those are in [`crate::authorization`], because
//!   "who you are" and "what you may do" are separate questions and conflating
//!   them is how role checks end up hard-coded.
