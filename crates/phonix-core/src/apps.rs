//! What a workspace can switch on.
//!
//! An app is a product: Books, and one day a CRM, a procurement module, an
//! inventory. A workspace subscribes to some of them and not to others, and the
//! ones it has not subscribed to should be invisible - not greyed out, not
//! answering with "forbidden", simply not part of that workspace's software.
//!
//! # Installing is not loading
//!
//! Nothing arrives at runtime. Apps are crates, compiled into one binary and
//! one wasm bundle, and every tenant database has every app's schema migrated
//! into it whether the workspace uses it or not. That is deliberate: a schema
//! that appears the moment somebody subscribes is a migration running under a
//! live request, and a bundle that fetches a route is a security surface.
//!
//! Installing an app **enables** it, and enabling it is a fact about the
//! *workspace* rather than about anybody's role. `phonix_services::workspace::apps`
//! has the detail; the shape is that enabling grants the app's permission
//! subtree to the static roles, so somebody can reach the new pages, and
//! disabling revokes nothing at all.
//!
//! Disabling instead *filters*: `PermissionSet::for_enabled_apps` is applied
//! where an `AuthUser` is assembled, so a permission for an app the workspace
//! has switched off is not a permission anybody holds. Everything downstream -
//! the menu, the command palette, the grids, and `Caller::require` in every
//! service - already answers to permissions, so enablement reaches all of them
//! without a second mechanism, and without destroying a role structure that
//! took somebody a week to build. See
//! `docs/adr/0006-apps-ports-and-defaults.md` section 1.
//!
//! # Why the catalog lives here
//!
//! `phonix-core` compiles to wasm, and the browser is where the app launcher,
//! the store and the install dialog are drawn. The migration registry in
//! `phonix_db::tenancy::apps` cannot be: it holds `sqlx::Migrator`. So this is
//! the description and that is the plumbing, and a test over there asserts the
//! two name the same apps.
//!
//! # Adding an app
//!
//! One entry in [`CATALOG`], four message keys, an icon in
//! `phonix_web::apps::icon_of`, and the permissions it names declared in
//! [`crate::authorization::definitions`]. The tests here refuse everything
//! else: an unknown dependency, an undeclared permission, an id that is not a
//! legal Postgres schema name.
