//! A span of time, as a filter carries it.
//!
//! # Two keys, not one
//!
//! [`PageRequest::filters`](super::PageRequest::filters) is a flat map of
//! strings, and a range is two values. Rather than invent an encoding inside
//! one value - `"a..b"`, which then has to be split by every reader and quoted
//! by none of them - a range declared as `occurred` occupies two ordinary
//! filter keys, `occurred_from` and `occurred_to`. Each half is a filter in its
//! own right: absent means unbounded, which is what makes "everything since
//! Monday" expressible without a second control.
//!
//! # Half-open, always
//!
//! `from` is included and `to` is excluded. Every other convention has the same
//! bug in it: a range written as two dates and compared with `<=` either loses
//! the last day entirely (when `to` is midnight) or has to invent
//! `23:59:59.999`, which is wrong by a millisecond for as long as anyone stores
//! microseconds. `[Monday 00:00, Tuesday 00:00)` is exactly Monday and needs no
//! footnote.
//!
//! # Absolute instants, resolved before they are sent
//!
//! What crosses the wire is always two RFC 3339 instants. A name - "this week",
//! "last year" - is resolved by whoever offered the control, never sent. That
//! is deliberate:
//!
//! * a reader does not have to own a calendar, and cannot disagree with the
//!   screen about when a week starts
//! * the range the viewer is looking at in the two date fields is the range
//!   that was asked for, so the control cannot lie
//! * a request stays reproducible: the same request run tomorrow returns the
//!   same rows, which is what an audit needs and what "this week" would break
