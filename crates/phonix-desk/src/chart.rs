//! The geometry behind Desk's charts, in numbers a template can only place.
//!
//! # Why this is arithmetic and not a library
//!
//! Desk's charts are drawn as inline SVG whose fills are the same CSS custom
//! properties every other Desk surface uses - `var(--brand)`, `var(--danger)`.
//! That is what makes a chart follow the light and dark themes, and follow the
//! accent the deployment chose, without rendering twice. A plotting crate bakes
//! resolved colours into its output and brings its own typography and axis
//! chrome, so the chart would stop matching the page it sits on the moment
//! either changed. The shapes here are a column and a stacked bar; the cost of
//! owning that arithmetic is this file, and what it buys is a chart that is
//! part of the design system rather than a picture pasted into it.
//!
//! # Every decision is made here, none in the template
//!
//! Bar positions, the rounded path, which columns are worth labelling, where
//! the label sits, the axis ticks: all computed, all handed over as numbers and
//! strings. The template's whole job is to put them in attributes. A template
//! that computed a bar height would be a second place the chart is defined, and
//! the one place nothing can test.
//!
//! # What the marks follow
//!
//! Thin marks and recessive chrome: a column is capped at [`MAX_BAR`] wide with
//! a 4px rounded data-end and a square foot on the baseline, neighbours are
//! separated by [`BAR_GAP`] of plain surface rather than by a stroke, gridlines
//! are solid hairlines one step off the surface, and values are labelled
//! *selectively* - the tallest column and the most recent one - because a
//! number over every bar is read as noise and skipped.
