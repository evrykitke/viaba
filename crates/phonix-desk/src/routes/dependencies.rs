//! Whether the box answers: the catalog, Redis and RabbitMQ.
//!
//! The first question when a workspace is misbehaving, and the one this tool
//! is best placed to answer - Desk runs in its own process, so a page that
//! renders at all has already proved that `phonix-server` being wedged is not
//! why you cannot see anything.
//!
//! # Its own page, and not a panel on the workspace list
//!
//! ADR 0005 calls it a panel, and the workspace list is where somebody lands.
//! It is here instead for the reason `queues` is: the home page must stay
//! cheap enough to reload without thinking about it, and these probes are
//! network round trips that are fast when everything is up and up to three
//! seconds each when it is not. Putting them on the landing page would make
//! the screen that says which workspace is wedged slowest at exactly the
//! moment it is wanted - and would couple Desk's first page to infrastructure
//! Desk deliberately does not depend on.
//!
//! # Nothing to press
//!
//! Reloading is the retry. A button that restarts a service would be the
//! remote shell with a login form that ADR 0005 section 12 refuses, and
//! execution stays on SSH.
