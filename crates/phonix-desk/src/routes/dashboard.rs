//! The estate at a glance: the page Desk opens on.
//!
//! Six numbers, the shape of the estate, and three series - how many
//! workspaces arrived, when the licences run out, and what desk users have
//! been doing. It is the landing page because it is the screen that says
//! whether anything needs attention at all; the workspace list, which says
//! *which* thing, is one click away at `/workspaces`.
//!
//! # It is cheap on purpose
//!
//! One catalog query with the licence joined on, and one aggregate over
//! `desk_audit`. No tenant pool is opened and no dependency is dialled - those
//! are `/queues` and `/dependencies`, each its own page for its own cost. A
//! landing page that reloads slowly is a landing page people stop reloading.
//!
//! # The charts are SVG this crate draws itself
//!
//! See [`crate::chart`] for why there is no plotting library under this. The
//! short version: the fills are the same CSS custom properties as every other
//! Desk surface, so a chart follows the theme and the accent without being
//! rendered twice, and a crate that baked its own palette in could not.
