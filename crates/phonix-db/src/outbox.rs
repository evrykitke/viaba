//! The transactional outbox (`outbox_events`).
//!
//! The table has existed since migration 0001 and this is what finally writes
//! to it. The problem it solves is small to state and impossible to fix any
//! other way:
//!
//! > Something changed, and something else needs to hear about it. Publishing
//! > to the broker and committing the change are two operations against two
//! > systems, and there is no order in which both are safe.
//!
//! Publish first and the transaction may roll back: an event announcing
//! something that never happened. Commit first and the process may die: a
//! change nobody was told about. Retrying does not help - it moves the window,
//! it does not close it.
//!
//! The outbox closes it by making the announcement part of the change. The
//! event is inserted **in the same transaction** as the rows it describes, so
//! it commits if and only if they do. A relay then reads unpublished rows and
//! sends them, which can fail as often as it likes: the row is still there.
//!
//! ```text
//!   BEGIN
//!     UPDATE file_uploads SET status = 'stored' ...
//!     INSERT INTO outbox_events (routing_key, payload) ...
//!   COMMIT                                    <- both, or neither
//!
//!   ... later, and possibly much later ...
//!
//!   relay: claim unpublished -> publish to rabbitmq -> mark published
//! ```
//!
//! # Delivery is at least once, and that is a promise to consumers
//!
//! A relay that publishes and then dies before marking the row will publish
//! again on the next pass. That is the correct trade - the alternative loses
//! events - and it is why every message carries a `message_id` and why the
//! tenant databases have a `processed_events` table. A handler that is not
//! idempotent is a handler with a bug.
