//! The apps compiled into this build, and what each tenant has installed.
//!
//! An app owns one Postgres schema inside every tenant database and one
//! migration stream of its own. Installing it is `CREATE SCHEMA` plus that
//! stream; uninstalling it is an export and `DROP SCHEMA`, which is only ever
//! safe because no app schema may hold a foreign key into another one.
//!
//! # Why the registry is compiled in
//!
//! Apps are crates, not plugins. The hydrate bundle is built once and shipped
//! to every browser, so there is nowhere for a route, a form config or a
//! permission to arrive from at runtime. What varies per tenant is which of the
//! compiled-in apps is *switched on* - and that is a subscription question,
//! answered in the catalog database, not here.
//!
//! # Adding an app
//!
//! One entry in [`APPS`], and a directory of migrations beside core's:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // crates/phonix-db/src/lib.rs
//! pub static BOOKS_MIGRATIONS: sqlx::migrate::Migrator =
//!     sqlx::migrate!("../../migrations/apps/books");
//!
//! // here
//! AppMigrations { app_id: "books", migrator: &crate::BOOKS_MIGRATIONS },
//! ```
//!
//! Two rules the migrations themselves have to keep, neither of which the
//! compiler can check:
//!
//! * **Qualify every reference to core.** `core.users`, never `users`. An app's
//!   search path is its own schema and `public`; core is absent on purpose, so
//!   an unqualified reference fails loudly instead of resolving by luck.
//! * **No foreign key into another app's schema.** Reference by id and resolve
//!   through a capability port. An FK is what makes an app impossible to
//!   uninstall.
//!
//! See `docs/adr/0001-core-boundary.md`.
