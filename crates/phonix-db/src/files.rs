//! The `file_uploads` table: uploads in flight, and the files they became.
//!
//! One table serving two purposes, which is deliberate - see the header comment
//! on migration `0009_files.sql` for why the job and the file share a row and
//! an id.
//!
//! # This module is also the job queue
//!
//! [`claim_batch`] and [`claim_one`] are `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
//! against the partial index on outstanding work. That is the whole of the
//! dispatch mechanism, and it is worth being explicit about why it is here
//! rather than in RabbitMQ:
//!
//! * The row is written either way, so the queue costs nothing extra.
//! * Claiming a job and changing its state are then **one transaction**. With a
//!   broker they are two, and everything that goes wrong with background work
//!   lives in the gap between them.
//! * `SKIP LOCKED` is what makes several workers safe without a lock table: a
//!   row another worker holds is passed over rather than waited for.
//!
//! The broker still carries the *result* outward, through the outbox - see
//! [`crate::outbox`]. What it does not carry is the work itself.
//!
//! # Nothing here decides anything
//!
//! No policy, no verification, no naming. A row goes in, a row comes out. What
//! a file is allowed to be lives in `phonix_core::files`, and the deciding is
//! done by `phonix_services::files`.
