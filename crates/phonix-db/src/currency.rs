//! `currencies` and `exchange_rates`: what this workspace deals in, and what a
//! rate was on a day.
//!
//! # The row is the selection, not the currency
//!
//! Names and minor units come from `phonix_core::locale::Currency`, which is
//! compiled in. This table says only *which* codes the workspace uses, so a row
//! decodes into a `Currency` and there is nothing else in it to read. See
//! migration 0015 for why the ISO list is not duplicated per tenant.
//!
//! # Numerics cross as text
//!
//! `NUMERIC` has no lossless integer binding in the driver, and the whole point
//! of [`Money`](phonix_core::money::Money) and [`Rate`] is that they are exact.
//! So amounts and rates are bound as `$n::numeric` and read back with `::text`.
//! It looks roundabout and it is the only form that cannot lose a digit.
//!
//! # There is no delete
//!
//! A currency the workspace has stopped using is disabled, not removed. Rates
//! and posted documents still have to resolve, and a foreign key error naming
//! `exchange_rates` is not a useful answer to somebody tidying up a picker.
