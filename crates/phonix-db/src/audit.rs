//! The change trail (`entity_events`).
//!
//! One row per change to one record: which kind of thing, which one, what
//! happened to it, and the `{from, to}` that says what moved. The security
//! trail next door in [`crate::identity::audit`] answers a different question -
//! who signed in, who was locked out - and the two are kept apart for the
//! reasons set out in `phonix_core::audit`.
//!
//! Recording is best-effort on the same terms as the security trail: losing a
//! trail row is bad, and refusing an administrator's save because the trail is
//! unwritable is worse.
//!
//! # Nothing in here decides what to record
//!
//! This module writes what it is handed and reads what is there. Which entity a
//! save is about, whether anything actually moved, and what the record is
//! called are decisions with a use case behind them, and they live in
//! `phonix_services::audit`.
