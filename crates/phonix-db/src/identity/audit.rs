//! The security audit trail (`identity_events`).
//!
//! This is where the truth about a failed sign-in goes. The login form itself
//! must stay vague - saying "no such account" turns it into an enumeration
//! oracle - so the specific reason is recorded here instead, where only people
//! with `Pages.Administration.AuditLogs` can read it.
//!
//! Recording is best-effort: a failure to write an audit row is logged and
//! swallowed rather than failing the request it describes. The alternative is
//! that a full disk locks everyone out of the application.
