//! The `api_keys` table: bearer credentials for `/api/v1`.
//!
//! The same rule as [`session`](super::session) and
//! [`one_time_token`](super::one_time_token): **every function here takes a
//! digest**, never a token. Minting one, prefixing it and digesting it are the
//! application layer's job, so no repository in this crate ever holds a
//! credential a client could present.
//!
//! Liveness is decided in SQL rather than in Rust. A key is live when it has
//! not been revoked and has not expired, and both halves are in the `WHERE`
//! clause of the lookup - so a caller that forgets to check cannot resurrect a
//! dead key, and a purge is housekeeping rather than a correctness requirement.
//!
//! What this table does *not* hold is what the key may do. The scopes narrow
//! the owner's permissions; the permissions themselves are resolved from
//! `role_permissions` and `user_permissions` on every request. A copy here
//! would be a second answer to a question `core` already answers, and it would
//! be the stale one - see docs/adr/0002-public-api.md.
