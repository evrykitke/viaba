//! PostgreSQL access for a database-per-tenant deployment.
//!
//! Two kinds of database:
//!
//! * **catalog** - one shared database (`phonix_catalog`) holding the tenant
//!   registry. One long-lived pool, created at startup.
//! * **tenant**  - one database per tenant (`phonix_tenant_<slug>`). Pools are
//!   created lazily on first request and evicted when the tenant goes idle, so
//!   a thousand registered tenants do not mean a thousand open pools.
//!
//! Queries use the runtime `sqlx::query*` functions rather than the compile-time
//! `query!` macros. The macros would require a reachable database (and one
//! chosen tenant's schema) at build time, which is the wrong trade for a
//! multi-database application and for CI.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! | Module            | Scope                                                |
//! | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
//! | [`connect`]       | Pools and connections, catalog and tenant            |
//! | [`tenancy`]       | The catalog, the pool registry, provisioning         |
//! | [`identity`]      | `users`, `sessions`, `user_tokens`, MFA factors, audit |
//! | [`audit`]         | `entity_events` - one row per change to one record   |
//! | [`currency`]      | `currencies`, `exchange_rates`                       |
//! | [`numbering`]     | `number_sequences` - the next document number        |
//! | [`authorization`] | `roles`, `role_permissions`, `user_permissions`      |
//! | [`settings`]      | `workspace_settings`                                 |
//! | [`files`]         | `file_uploads` - and the queue the upload jobs run on |
//! | [`outbox`]        | `outbox_events` - events written with the change they describe |
//!
//! `tenancy` works against the catalog; everything else works against exactly
//! one tenant database and carries no tenant column - isolation is the database
//! boundary, so a query that reaches the wrong workspace is a routing bug rather
//! than a missing `WHERE` clause.
//!
//! # What belongs here, and what does not
//!
//! This is the **data access layer**. A function here reads or writes rows and
//! nothing else. In particular it holds no use cases: "sign in" is not a query,
//! it is a sequence of them with decisions in between, and it lives in
//! `phonix-services` along with the hashing, the TOTP arithmetic and the
//! cipher.
//!
//! One rule follows from that and is worth stating plainly: **no repository in
//! this crate ever receives a credential in a form it could use.** Passwords
//! arrive as PHC strings, session and one-time tokens as digests, TOTP secrets
//! as sealed bytes. A dump of what this layer can see is a dump of things that
//! cannot be presented anywhere.
//!
//! ```text
//!   phonix-services   use cases: sign_in, onboard_workspace, enrol_totp
//!         |           hashes, seals, digests, decides
//!         v
//!   phonix-db         repositories: rows in, rows out          <- you are here
//!         |
//!         v
//!   PostgreSQL        one catalog database, one database per tenant
//! ```
//!
//! # The database refuses; it does not act
//!
//! No triggers, no stored procedures, no rules. What PostgreSQL enforces is
//! what the data *may be* - `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, `REFERENCES`, `UNIQUE`, and a
//! `DEFAULT` on insert. Those refuse a bad write; they never perform one of
//! their own. Everything that decides is Rust, in this crate or above it.
//!
//! The line matters because a trigger is behaviour that is invisible where it
//! happens. Five `updated_at` triggers used to live in `core`, and by the time
//! they were removed (migration 0017) both had gone wrong in the same quiet
//! way: `users.updated_at` moved on every page view, because `last_seen_at` is
//! a write; and `number_sequences.updated_at` moved on every document issued,
//! leaving it disagreeing with the `updated_by` beside it.
//!
//! So `updated_at` is set at the call site, and the rule is:
//!
//! > **`updated_at` follows an edit to the row's own data.** It does not follow
//! > the login trail - `last_seen_at`, `last_login_at`, `failed_login_count`,
//! > `locked_until` - and it does not follow allocating a document number.
//!
//! A migration that adds a trigger or a function fails the `tenant_schema`
//! test, which asserts the absence rather than counting what is there.
