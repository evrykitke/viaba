//! # Why the request does so little
//!
//! Everything worth doing to an uploaded file has to survive the connection
//! dropping. Deciding what it is, hashing it, moving it, and one day scanning
//! it, are all work that must not be lost because somebody closed a laptop -
//! and none of it is work the person uploading is waiting on. So the request
//! writes bytes and a row and stops, and the row is the queue.
//!
//! That also gives one answer to a question that otherwise has none: what
//! happens when the process dies mid-upload? The bytes are in quarantine under
//! a name nothing points at, the row does not exist, and the sweeper removes
//! them. There is no state to reconcile because there is no second place the
//! truth could be.
//!
//! # The three places a file can be
//!
//! * **Quarantine** - arrived, not yet looked at. Nothing serves from here.
//! * **A bucket** - verified, renamed, and the only place a download reads.
//! * **Gone** - refused, or deleted. The object is removed before the row is
//!   updated, so a row never points at bytes that are not there.
