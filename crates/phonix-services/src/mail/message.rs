//! What a message says.
//!
//! # Built here rather than templated
//!
//! There is no template engine and no `templates/` directory, deliberately.
//! Three messages, each a dozen lines, do not pay for a renderer - and a
//! template file is one more thing that can be missing at runtime, in a binary
//! that otherwise cannot be. When a fourth and fifth arrive with content an
//! administrator edits, that is the moment to reconsider, and the shape here -
//! one function per message returning a [`Mail`] - is what makes that a local
//! change.
//!
//! # Both parts, every time
//!
//! Every message is text *and* HTML. The text part is not a fallback nobody
//! reads: it is what a screen reader, a watch, a terminal client and a spam
//! filter all see, and a single-part HTML message is what scores worst at the
//! last of those.
//!
//! # A link is a credential
//!
//! An invitation link signs somebody in. It is stated once, with its expiry
//! next to it, and the message says plainly what to do if it was not expected -
//! which is the only defence against an invitation sent to the wrong address.

/// One message, ready for a relay.
