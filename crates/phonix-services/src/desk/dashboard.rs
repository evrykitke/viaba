//! The estate at a glance: what Desk knows about the platform as a whole.
//!
//! Every other Desk screen answers a question about one thing - this workspace,
//! this account, this day's audit rows. This one answers questions about the
//! shape of the estate: how many workspaces there are, how many are actually
//! serving, how many are behind the build, and when the licences run out.
//!
//! # It costs one catalog read and one audit read, and nothing else
//!
//! Every workspace number here comes out of `workspace::list`, which the
//! catalog already answers in one query with the licence joined on. Nothing
//! opens a tenant pool - see [`crate::desk::queues`] for why that is a page of
//! its own - so this stays cheap enough to be the page somebody lands on.
//!
//! # It reads no business data
//!
//! ADR 0005 section 6. Everything counted here is a fact about a workspace as
//! an *object*: its status, its schema version, when it was created, whether
//! something authorizes it. Nothing inside one is read, and there is no query
//! here that could be widened into reading it.
