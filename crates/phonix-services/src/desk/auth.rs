//! Signing in to Evrykit Desk.
//!
//! Two steps, always. A password opens a session that can reach exactly one
//! page - the code box - and a TOTP code turns that session into a sign-in.
//! There is no parameter anywhere here for skipping the second step, because a
//! parameter is how one gets skipped.
//!
//! # What a refusal says
//!
//! Nothing. An unknown address, a wrong password, a locked account, a disabled
//! one and an account that never finished setup all produce the same
//! [`SignInOutcome::Rejected`], and the unknown-address path still spends the
//! time a real Argon2 verification costs. The audit row says which it was; the
//! response does not.
//!
//! # The one thing that is not constant-time, and why that is fine
//!
//! A locked account is refused before the hash is computed, so a lockout is
//! observable by timing. That is deliberate: burning 19 MiB and two iterations
//! per guess is exactly what a lockout exists to stop, and the fact being
//! leaked - "this address is currently locked" - is one a persistent attacker
//! learns anyway by watching it stop responding to correct passwords.
