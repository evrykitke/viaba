//! Switching an app on for a workspace, and off again.
//!
//! # Installing does not install anything
//!
//! The schema is already there. Every app compiled into this build has had its
//! migrations run in every tenant database, on boot, whether the workspace uses
//! it or not - see `phonix_db::tenancy::provision`. So [`install`] writes one
//! timestamp and then re-syncs the static roles, and that second part is what
//! makes the app appear: the menu, the command palette, every grid and every
//! `Caller::require` in every service already answer to permissions, so
//! granting the subtree beneath the app's root turns all of them on at once.
//!
//! Doing it the other way round - a schema created on subscription - would put
//! DDL under a live request and leave a half-migrated database as an ordinary
//! outcome. Doing it with a second gate beside permissions would be two things
//! to keep in step, and one of them would eventually be forgotten in a service
//! nobody thought about.
//!
//! # The eight seconds are the browser's, not this file's
//!
//! [`install`] returns as soon as the write commits, which is fast. The install
//! dialog holds a progress animation for its own reasons - a subscription that
//! completes between two frames reads as a button that did nothing - and that
//! is a decision about perception, made where perception happens. Putting a
//! sleep in here would make every future caller wait too: the API, a script,
//! a bulk provisioning run.
//!
//! # Switching off deletes nothing at all
//!
//! Not the app's rows, and - since ADR 0006 - not the permission grants either.
//! [`uninstall`] writes one column, `installed_apps.enabled_at`, and stops.
//!
//! This used to revoke: `role::revoke_everywhere(app.permission)`, which
//! deleted every grant beneath the app's root from every role in the workspace
//! including the ones the organization wrote themselves, plus every per-user
//! override. The justification was that a role is not a subscription. The
//! trouble is that it made a lapsed subscription cost an organization the
//! permission structure they had spent a week building, silently - nothing told
//! the administrator that switching Books off had just erased eleven grants
//! across four roles - and switching it back on could not put them back,
//! because the rows were gone.
//!
//! What replaces it is a *filter*, applied once where an `AuthUser` is
//! assembled: `PermissionSet::for_enabled_apps` in
//! `identity::authentication::load_auth_user`. A disabled app is still gone
//! from the menu, the launcher, the palette and every grid, and its services
//! still refuse - because all of those read the filtered set - so this is not a
//! cosmetic toggle and an unpaid app cannot be reached by guessing a URL. It is
//! simply reversible.
//!
//! The old objection to a second gate still stands and is the reason the filter
//! goes where the set is *built* rather than where it is checked: there is one
//! call site, so a service that forgets about enablement is not a thing that can
//! exist. See `docs/adr/0006-apps-ports-and-defaults.md` section 1.
