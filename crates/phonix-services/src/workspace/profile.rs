//! Reading and changing who the organization says it is.
//!
//! Two things happen here that a repository must not do on its own: the profile
//! is validated field by field before it is written, and the change is recorded
//! on the change trail as a `{from, to}` pair. The legal name, the registration
//! number and the address are what appear on everything this workspace issues,
//! so "who changed it, and to what" is the question asked after a document goes
//! out wrong - and a bare `UPDATE` cannot answer it.
//!
//! # The logo is not saved here
//!
//! [`save`] does not touch it. Attaching a logo is
//! [`files::set_logo`](crate::files::set_logo), because it is a file operation:
//! it has to check that the upload finished and was accepted, and it has to
//! delete the image it replaces. What this module does is *read* it back, so
//! the screen can show what is currently set.
