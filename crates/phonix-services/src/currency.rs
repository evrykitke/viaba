//! Which currencies this workspace deals in, and what a rate was on a day.
//!
//! # Reading is ungated; writing is `Settings`
//!
//! The same split the workspace policy makes. Every screen with an amount on it
//! needs the currency list to render a picker, and a posting routine needs a
//! rate - so requiring a permission to *read* would mean granting the
//! administration area to anybody who can raise a document. Changing the list,
//! or recording a rate, is administration.
//!
//! # The list is audited as one record
//!
//! [`kinds::CURRENCIES`] is a singleton. "Who switched EUR off" and "who loaded
//! Tuesday's rates" are the same question about the same screen, and a history
//! per currency code would be a hundred and sixty histories nobody navigates
//! to.
//!
//! # A rate is recorded, never invented
//!
//! [`rate_on`] answers with a rate somebody published on a stated day, or with
//! nothing. It never interpolates between two rates and never extrapolates
//! backwards past the earliest on file: an auditor asks *which published rate
//! was used*, and "a blend of Tuesday and Thursday" is not an answer.
