//! Parties: the organizations and people a workspace trades with.
//!
//! # Deleting one is refused more often than it is allowed
//!
//! Nothing in `master` points at a party except its own children. An app that
//! has raised documents against one holds its id *without* a foreign key -
//! that is the no-cross-schema-FK rule, and it is what makes an app
//! uninstallable. So the database cannot answer "is this party in use", and
//! [`delete`] does not pretend otherwise: it refuses a party that any app has
//! claimed a role on, and offers deactivation instead.
//!
//! That is deliberately conservative. A party with a `customer` role has been
//! used by Books as far as anything here can tell, and a customer deleted out
//! from under a posted invoice is a document that can no longer name who it was
//! for.
//!
//! # Addresses and contacts are their own saves
//!
//! Not fields on the party form, for the reason the organization's logo is not
//! a field on the organization form: a draft opened before somebody else
//! corrected a postcode would otherwise put the old one back as a side effect
//! of changing a phone number.
