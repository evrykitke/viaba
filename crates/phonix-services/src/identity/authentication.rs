//! Signing in: the one path where every defence has to line up.
//!
//! Five rules govern everything below.
//!
//! **Rejections are indistinguishable.** No such address, wrong password,
//! suspended account, soft-deleted account - all return
//! [`LoginResult::Rejected`]. Any difference the caller can observe turns the
//! form into an oracle for which addresses have accounts. The real reason goes
//! to `identity_events`.
//!
//! **Rejections cost the same.** A missing account still pays for a full
//! Argon2 verification against a dummy hash. Without that, "no such user"
//! returns in microseconds while "wrong password" takes 50 ms, and the
//! difference is trivially measurable over the network.
//!
//! **The lockout is checked before the password.** Otherwise a locked account
//! is still a working password oracle, just a slow one.
//!
//! **A successful sign-in is the only chance to upgrade a hash.** It is the one
//! moment the plaintext exists, so a hash made with weaker parameters is
//! re-made here or never.
//!
//! **The workspace's own policy is applied last.** A correct password can still
//! end at the enrolment screen or the change-password screen, because the
//! organization requires a second factor or expires passwords. Those are
//! outcomes, not rejections: the session exists, it just cannot reach anything
//! else yet.
