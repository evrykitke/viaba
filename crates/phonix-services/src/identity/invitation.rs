//! Inviting somebody, and accepting an invitation.
//!
//! # The order of operations is the whole design
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. create the account   password_hash NULL, status Pending
//! 2. assign its roles
//! 3. issue the token      superseding any outstanding invitation
//! 4. send the email       may fail; does not undo 1-3
//! ```
//!
//! Steps 1 to 3 are one transaction. Step 4 is deliberately outside it, and
//! deliberately not allowed to fail the request: an account that exists with an
//! undelivered invitation is recoverable - copy the link, or re-send once the
//! relay works - while a request that rolled back because a mail server was
//! briefly unreachable leaves the administrator wondering what happened and
//! whether to try again.
//!
//! So [`invite`] returns the link in [`InvitationIssued`] whether or not it was
//! emailed, and the screen decides how loudly to present it.
//!
//! # Accepting is where the password is set
//!
//! [`accept`] is the only place an invited account gets a password, and the
//! person setting it is the person who will use it. It consumes the token,
//! applies the workspace's password policy, and moves the account to `Active`
//! with its address already verified - opening the link *is* the proof that the
//! address receives mail.
