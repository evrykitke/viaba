//! API keys: issuing one, listing them, stopping one, and turning a presented
//! token back into a [`Caller`].
//!
//! See `docs/adr/0002-public-api.md` for the decisions this implements. Three
//! of them are load-bearing here and worth repeating where the code is:
//!
//! **The database never sees a token.** [`issue`] mints 32 bytes, prefixes
//! them, hands the whole thing back exactly once, and stores the SHA-256
//! digest. There is no way to recover a key afterwards, by design and by
//! construction - nothing in the row can be turned back into the secret.
//!
//! **A key cannot exceed the person who issued it, ever.** Not at issue time -
//! [`issue`] refuses a scope the issuer does not hold - and not afterwards:
//! [`authenticate`] intersects the key's scopes with the owner's *current*
//! permissions, read fresh on every request. Removing a grant from a user, or
//! suspending them, therefore removes it from every key they issued, with
//! nothing here to keep in step.
//!
//! **Scopes are permission names.** A scope of `Pages.Administration.Settings`
//! covers everything beneath it exactly as a grant does, because it is checked
//! by the same tree. An API-specific scope vocabulary would be a second list
//! saying the same thing, and the two would disagree within a release.
