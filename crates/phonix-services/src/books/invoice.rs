//! Raising, pricing, posting and voiding a sales invoice.
//!
//! # Four permissions, because they are four different powers
//!
//! Reading a customer's invoices is not raising one, raising one is not
//! *posting* it - which takes a number nobody can hand back - and posting is
//! not voiding a document that has already been sent.
//!
//! # Posting is the only irreversible act
//!
//! [`post`] takes a number from `core.number_sequences` in the same transaction
//! as the write, so a failure returns the number rather than burning it. What
//! it cannot undo is the *decision*: after it, the document is frozen and a
//! mistake is corrected by voiding it and raising another. That is not a
//! limitation, it is what makes an invoice evidence.
//!
//! # The snapshot happens here
//!
//! The party's name and address are copied onto the draft every time it is
//! saved, and the tax rates are resolved against the document's own date. By
//! the time an invoice is posted, nothing on it needs looking up again.
