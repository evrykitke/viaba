//! The sign-in screen.
//!
//! Rendered at `/`. It adapts to where it is running: on a workspace host the
//! tenant is known and the form asks for two things, on the bare domain it also
//! asks which workspace. See `server_fns::auth_fns` for why those are two
//! different code paths on the server.
//!
//! Nothing here checks whether the visitor is already signed in. That is
//! `phonix_core::identity::landing`, applied by the layout before this renders,
//! so an established session is turned around with a 302 rather than being
//! shown a form it then navigates away from.
//!
//! # The card, and what is outside it
//!
//! One card holds everything somebody does to get in: the fields, the button
//! and the alternative to the password. Everything *around* it is somewhere
//! else to go - forgotten password, no workspace yet - and sits outside on
//! purpose. A person who is signing in successfully should never have to read
//! past the button, and a person who cannot get in is looking for exactly the
//! links the card does not contain.
//!
//! # Responsive without a single measurement
//!
//! `max-w-measure` and a padding step at `sm:` do all of it. Nothing here asks
//! how wide the window is: a viewport read in Rust renders one tree on the
//! server and a different one in the browser, and that mismatch is a wasm panic
//! that freezes the whole application. Every width decision is a CSS class.
//!
//! # Every string here comes from the catalog
//!
//! This screen is the worked example for `crate::i18n`. `l!` for words this
//! file owns, `t` for a [`Message`] that arrived from the server - a rejection
//! from `sign_in` is the latter, because the service decided *what* was wrong
//! and this decides how to say it here.
//!
//! The language picker used to live at the foot of this file. It is in the
//! public footer now: somebody who cannot read the reset screen has the same
//! problem as somebody who cannot read this one, and it was only on this one.
