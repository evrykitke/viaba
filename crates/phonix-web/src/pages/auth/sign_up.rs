//! The signup wizard.
//!
//! Three screens, **one request**. The wizard collects an account on step one,
//! a workspace on step two, and submits both together - a catalog row with no
//! owner, or an owner with no database, is a state nobody wants to reason about
//! later. Step three is the provisioning screen.
//!
//! Validation runs twice by design. The client's copy is
//! `phonix_core::identity::SignupInput::validate` compiled to WebAssembly, so
//! the messages are the same ones the server will produce; the server runs it
//! again because this endpoint is reachable without a browser.
//!
//! # The five seconds on the last screen are deliberate
//!
//! Creating a database, running its migrations, writing a permission tree and
//! the owner account is real work and takes a moment. It is not reliably five
//! seconds - on a warm machine it can be well under one - and the last screen
//! holds for [`PROVISION_HOLD`] regardless.
//!
//! That is a decision, not a measurement, and it is worth being straight about
//! which. The alternative is a form that blinks and is replaced by a different
//! host mid-blink, which reads as a crash: no confirmation that anything was
//! created, no chance to see the workspace's name, and a cross-origin
//! navigation arriving with no warning. The steps listed are the real ones in
//! the real order; their *pacing* is fixed. Nothing here is a progress bar
//! pretending to know something it does not - it is a bar counting down a hold
//! this file chose.
//!
//! If the server takes longer than the hold, the screen simply waits: the
//! redirect needs both the response and the timer, and whichever is slower
//! decides.
//!
//! # Responsive without a single measurement
//!
//! Every width decision below is a Tailwind class. Nothing asks how wide the
//! window is - a viewport read in Rust renders one tree on the server and
//! another in the browser, and that mismatch is a wasm panic that freezes the
//! whole application.
