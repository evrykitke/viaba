//! The roles this workspace has defined, and what each grants.
//!
//! A role is a named bundle of permissions that reaches everybody holding it,
//! immediately - permissions are resolved per request, not frozen into a
//! session. That is what makes a role the right tool for "everybody in
//! accounts" and the individual editor the right tool for "everybody in
//! accounts except Sam".
//!
//! # Three screens, and why the middle one has tabs
//!
//! ```text
//! /admin/roles            the list        a grid
//! /admin/roles/new        define one      a form
//! /admin/roles/:id        one role        Details | Permissions
//! ```
//!
//! A role is two different things being edited by two different people at two
//! different moments: what it is *called*, which is settled once, and what it
//! *grants*, which is revisited. Putting both on one page meant one save button
//! for two decisions - and a permission tree with a name box balanced on top of
//! it, which is what made the screen feel like a form that had grown a tree
//! rather than a screen about a role.
//!
//! Tabs also give each half its own save. The details form is the kit's
//! [`EntityForm`]; the tree keeps its own, because what it submits is a set
//! rather than a draft, and its "unsaved, and this reaches N people" line is
//! the whole point of the button.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not offered
//!
//! Editing `Admin`. It holds the whole tree by definition and is rewritten from
//! the compiled definitions on every deploy, so a change made here would revert
//! at the next release - worse than being refused.
