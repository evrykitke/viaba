//! Minting an API key.
//!
//! # Why this is a page and not a modal over the grid
//!
//! The same reason as [`user_invite`](super::user_invite): what comes back is a
//! **secret shown once and never again**, and it needs somewhere it can be
//! read, selected and copied without a table scrolling underneath it. A modal
//! would also have to decide what closing means while a key is on screen, and
//! every answer is wrong, because closing is how the key is lost.
//!
//! # The scopes offered are the ones the person holds
//!
//! Built from the viewer, so nobody is offered a permission the service would
//! refuse to put on a key. The service checks anyway - this is a narrowed list,
//! not a control - and the two agreeing is what stops the screen offering a
//! choice that always fails.
