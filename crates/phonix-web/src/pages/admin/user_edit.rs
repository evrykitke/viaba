//! Editing one account.
//!
//! The screen is a heading and a form, the same way the users list is a heading
//! and a grid. Everything about *what* may be edited - the controls, which
//! permission each one needs, what is required, where the save goes and what
//! happens afterwards - is a configuration in
//! [`crate::ui::form::config::users`]. What is left here is the part that is
//! genuinely about this page: resolving the account and the roles before the
//! configuration can be built.
//!
//! # Why two things are resolved and not one
//!
//! A form configuration is built during a render and cannot await anything, so
//! the select's options have to exist before `user_form` is called. Fetching
//! them inside the field would draw an empty select and fill it in a moment
//! later, which quietly discards a choice made in that moment.
//!
//! Two resources rather than one that fetches both: a resource starts as soon
//! as it is created, so these two requests are already in flight together and
//! awaiting them in the same block is the join. Neither answer is needed to ask
//! for the other.
