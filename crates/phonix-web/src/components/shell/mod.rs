//! # One piece of state, shared
//!
//! [`Shell`] is provided once here and read by every part. It is `Copy` - all
//! signals - so a child takes it from context and holds it without lifetimes or
//! clones. What it carries:
//!
//! * the signed-in user, for permission gating, as a resource
//! * the [`Trail`] for the current URL, recomputed on navigation
//! * which groups the *user* has explicitly opened or closed
//! * whether the command palette is up
//! * whether the navigation drawer is open, on a narrow screen
//!
//! # Two panels, one component
//!
//! Below `md` the navigation panel is a drawer: absent from the layout, slid in
//! over the content, with a backdrop. At `md` and up it is a column in the flex
//! row that the collapse control narrows to a rail. Both are the same markup
//! with different classes rather than two components, because a second copy of
//! a permission-gated recursive menu is a second copy to keep correct.
//!
//! The rail is a desktop idea and is not offered on a drawer - there is no
//! screen where a 48px strip of icons is the right answer *and* the panel had
//! to be summoned to see it at all.
//!
//! # Expansion: the tree decides, the user overrides
//!
//! A group is open when the current route is inside it. That is the behaviour
//! asked for - navigate to a child and its ancestors open, at any depth - and
//! it needs no per-screen wiring because [`Trail`] resolves it from the URL.
//!
//! But a user who collapses the section they are standing in must stay
//! collapsed, and an "open" flag alone would be re-opened by the very next
//! render. So the map here holds *overrides*, not state: a key present means
//! "the user said so", a key absent means "follow the trail". Navigating
//! somewhere else clears nothing and needs to clear nothing, because the trail
//! moves underneath the untouched keys.
//!
//! # Why the user is a resource here rather than a prop
//!
//! The obvious shape is for the layout to await the session and hand it in.
//! That puts `<Outlet/>` - the page itself - inside a `Suspend`, and a route
//! outlet inside an async boundary stops swapping on navigation: clicking a
//! menu entry changes the URL and leaves the previous screen on the display
//! until the page is reloaded. The chrome resolves its own user instead, so the
//! outlet hangs off nothing but the router.
//!
//! Each part that needs the user therefore reads it inside its own `Suspense` -
//! the sidebar for permission gating, the palette for the same, the avatar menu
//! for a name. Those are small and independent; the page is neither.
