//! The collapsible navigation panel.
//!
//! Renders [`crate::navigation::MENU`] to whatever depth it is declared at. A
//! group is a button that opens its children; a leaf is a link. Which one is
//! highlighted, and which groups are open, both come from the [`Trail`] rather
//! than from anything a screen sets - see [`super`] for why.
//!
//! # Weight
//!
//! The open section carries the accent solid; the page you are on carries it
//! tinted. That order is deliberate and is the reverse of the obvious one: a
//! menu is read to answer "which list is this", and the heading answers that.
//! The page is already named by the heading at the top of the screen.
//!
//! Collapsed, the panel becomes a 48px rail of icons. Nested levels are hidden
//! there rather than squeezed: there is no honest way to show a third-level
//! item in 48 pixels, so clicking a group on the rail opens the panel back up
//! instead of pretending.
//!
//! Below `md` it is not a column at all but a drawer over the content, opened
//! from the top bar and closed by navigating, by the backdrop, or by Escape.
//! The rail is not offered there - see [`super`].
//!
