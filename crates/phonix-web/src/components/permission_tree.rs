//! The permission tree, with checkboxes.
//!
//! One component, two callers: the role editor and the per-account editor. They
//! differ in what they do with the answer, not in how the tree behaves, so the
//! tree does not know which one it is inside.
//!
//! # The two rules that make it usable
//!
//! **Ticking a child ticks its ancestors.** `Users.Create` without
//! `Administration` is an account that may create users and cannot open the
//! page that does it. **Unticking a parent unticks its subtree**, for the
//! mirror-image reason.
//!
//! Both are [`PermissionSet::grant`] and [`PermissionSet::revoke`] - the same
//! functions the server applies to whatever is submitted. The screen and the
//! server therefore cannot disagree about what a click meant, which is the
//! failure this component exists to avoid: a tree that lets you save a
//! selection the server then quietly rewrites.
//!
//! # Finding a permission, and hiding the ones you are not looking for
//!
//! Three controls, and they compose:
//!
//! * **the filter box** matches a label, a dotted name or a description;
//! * **only selected** hides everything not ticked;
//! * **the chevrons** shut a branch you are done with.
//!
//! The first two *suspend* the third. A branch that stayed shut while a filter
//! was running would hide the match inside it, which is a search that reports
//! nothing and is not wrong - the worst kind. So while anything is being
//! filtered the chevrons are not drawn at all, rather than drawn and ignored.
//!
//! A row survives a filter if **it** matches or **something beneath it** does.
//! Without that, searching "Delete" would show two leaves with no indication of
//! what they are the delete of.
//!
//! # An app the workspace has not switched on has no rows here
//!
//! Its permissions still exist - they are compiled in, and another workspace
//! holds them - but this one cannot. Both grant-writing services prune through
//! `for_enabled_apps` before they write, so a tick beside Books in a workspace
//! without Books is a control that is silently ignored on save. Offering it and
//! discarding it is worse than not offering it, so the tree narrows to what
//! this workspace can actually hold: `phonix_core::apps::covers` decides, and
//! [`crate::apps::InstalledApps`] supplies the list.
//!
//! The scope reaches further than the rows. A branch's `2/5` and its
//! part-ticked state count only what is in scope, or `Pages` would sit
//! permanently partial over children nobody can ever grant; and "select all"
//! selects what can be saved, or it would tick rows that vanish on submit.
//!
//! # Annotations
//!
//! A caller may pass `annotate` to label individual rows - "from role",
//! "denied for this user". The tree renders the label and stays out of the
//! meaning; deciding what a tick implies about storage is
//! [`phonix_core::authorization::grants`]'s job.
