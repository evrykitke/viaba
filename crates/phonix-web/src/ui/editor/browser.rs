//! The half of the editor that only exists in a browser.
//!
//! # Why any of this is hand-written
//!
//! `#[wasm_bindgen] extern "C"` would be shorter, and it binds a name that has
//! to exist when the glue module is evaluated. The bundle here is fetched on
//! demand - it is 130 KiB gzipped, and most pages have no editor on them - so
//! at the moment the glue would want `window.PhonixEditor`, there is no such
//! thing. `Reflect` looks the name up when it is used, which is the only order
//! that works.
//!
//! # Nothing here may panic
//!
//! Every lookup is a `Result`, and every failure returns rather than unwrapping.
//! A panic in wasm is not an error message: it poisons the runtime and *every*
//! handler on the page stops responding - see [`crate::recovery`]. An editor
//! that fails to load should be a form with no editor in it, which is
//! recoverable, and never a page that has stopped listening.
//!
//! The whole module is `hydrate`-only. The server renders the shell, the mount
//! point stays empty, and the editor is put into it after hydration - so there
//! is nothing here for an SSR build to call. See [`super`] for the empty
//! counterparts.
//!
//! Two layers, and the split is worth keeping: [`Editor`] is the boundary with
//! JavaScript and knows nothing about Leptos, and [`Dispatch`] is the wiring
//! that owns one for as long as a component is on screen.
