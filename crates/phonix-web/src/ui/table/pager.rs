//! The strip under the table: what is showing, and how to see the rest.
//!
//! # It says the range, not just the page
//!
//! "Showing 26-50 of 213" answers the question people actually have. "Page 2 of
//! 9" only answers it after they have worked out how big a page is, and it is
//! the same width on screen.
//!
//! # Nothing here owns a reactive value
//!
//! The strip is drawn inside the grid's `Transition`, and a transition disposes
//! the owner of what is on screen the moment a refetch starts - see the note on
//! zombie rows in [`menu`](super::menu). A `Callback` or a derived signal made
//! here would therefore be gone while the control that reads it is still on the
//! screen and still clickable, and reading one is a panic that takes the whole
//! page with it.
//!
//! Hence the shape of this file. The footing arrives as a plain value, the
//! buttons carry plain closures, and the one `Callback` a `SelectField` insists
//! on is made by the grid and handed in. All that is left for a handler to
//! touch is `state`, whose signals belong to the grid itself and outlive every
//! reload - which makes the strip correct during the window rather than merely
//! inert.
//!
//! The footing is still *read* through closures, and that is not decoration. A
//! `{move || ...}` child is a dynamic node, and the server writes hydration
//! markers around one; the same text written straight into the view is static
//! and gets none. Reading a plain value inline instead of through a closure
//! therefore changes what the browser walks when it hydrates, and the walk ends
//! in an unrecoverable hydration error rather than a wrong number. Plain value,
//! closure around it: both halves are load-bearing.
//!
//! # Numbered pages stay out of the way on a phone
//!
//! Previous and next are always there. The numbers between them are a window
//! around the current page - never the full list, because a hundred-page table
//! would otherwise render a hundred buttons - and they are hidden below `sm`,
//! where two arrows and a page count fit and eleven buttons do not.
