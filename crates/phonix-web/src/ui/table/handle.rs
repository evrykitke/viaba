//! How an action talks back to the grid it was clicked in.
//!
//! # Why a handle and not a context lookup
//!
//! An action's closure is written in a configuration file, long before any grid
//! exists, and it usually runs inside a spawned task after an `await` - by
//! which point reactive context lookups are a guess about which owner is
//! current. Passing the handle in as an argument makes the connection explicit
//! and impossible to get wrong:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! RowAction::run("Reset two-factor", Icon::ShieldOff, |user, grid| {
//!     spawn_local(async move {
//!         match reset_user_mfa(user.id).await {
//!             Ok(_) => { grid.report("Two-factor removed."); grid.refresh(); }
//!             Err(err) => grid.warn(err.to_string()),
//!         }
//!     });
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! # Refreshing is the grid's job, not the caller's
//!
//! An action that changes a row leaves the table showing the row as it was.
//! [`GridHandle::refresh`] re-runs whatever the source is - one fetch for an
//! in-memory grid, one page for a paged one - so a configuration never has to
//! know which kind it is attached to.
