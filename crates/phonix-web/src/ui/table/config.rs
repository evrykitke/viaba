//! What a grid is told, and what each entity tells it.
//!
//! # The shape of a configuration
//!
//! [`GridConfig`] is the whole contract between a module and the grid. It is
//! built with a chain of `with`-style methods so that a configuration reads
//! down the page as a description of the screen:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! GridConfig::new("users", Source::in_memory(list_users))
//!     .searching("Filter by name, email or role")
//!     .exports_as("users")
//!     .column(Column::new("display_name", "Person", ...).findable().pinned())
//!     .action(RowAction::link("Permissions", Icon::KeySquare, ...)
//!         .require(names::USERS_CHANGE_PERMISSIONS))
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here is a component. A module contributes a *value*, and the one
//! [`DataGrid`](super::DataGrid) renders it - which is what "each entity
//! extends the grid" means in a language without inheritance: the extension
//! point is the configuration, not a subclass.
//!
//! # Entity configurations live under this module
//!
//! One file per entity, named for it, exporting one function:
//!
//! ```text
//! ui/table/config/users.rs   ->  pub fn users_grid() -> GridConfig<UserListing>
//! ```
//!
//! Keeping them together rather than beside their pages is deliberate. A
//! configuration is a description of data - which fields exist, which are
//! searchable, what may be done to a row - and having them in one place is what
//! makes it obvious when two modules describe the same thing two ways.
