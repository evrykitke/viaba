//! Named narrowings: "only failures", "only low stock".
//!
//! # Why this is not the search box
//!
//! Search is free text, and every source answers it the same way - look inside
//! the row and see whether the words are there. A filter is a *named
//! predicate*: "notable" is not a word in any column, it is a question only the
//! module that defined it can answer.
//!
//! Modelling one as the other is the failure this avoids. A checkbox wired to
//! the search box would filter on whatever the word happened to match, and a
//! filter dropped into a column would have to be sortable, exportable and
//! searchable to fit through [`Column`](super::Column), which it is not.
//!
//! # A filter is answered where the rows are
//!
//! The chosen value travels in [`PageRequest::filters`], so both sources can
//! answer it, and each answers it in the only place it can:
//!
//! * [`Source::in_memory`](super::Source::in_memory) - the browser holds every
//!   row, so the filter is a closure over one row. Supply it with
//!   [`Filter::matching`].
//! * [`Source::paged`](super::Source::paged) - the browser holds one page and
//!   cannot know what it did not fetch, so the key crosses the wire and the
//!   reader turns it into a `WHERE` clause. No closure, and one would be a lie:
//!   it could only narrow the page already on screen.
//!
//! Getting that backwards is caught at build time in debug: see
//! [`GridConfig::filter`](super::GridConfig::filter).
//!
//! # The first choice is "all of them"
//!
//! Every filter opens showing everything, and the choice that means that
//! carries an empty value - which [`PageRequest::sanitised`] then drops, so a
//! reader never has to know both spellings of "not filtered".
