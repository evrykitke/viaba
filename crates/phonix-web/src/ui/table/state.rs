//! What the viewer has done to the table since it opened.
//!
//! Search text, page, page size, sort, and which columns are turned off. All of
//! it is per-view and none of it is stored: reopening a screen gives everyone
//! the same table, which is the version that can be described over a shoulder.
//!
//! # Every change but one resets to page one
//!
//! Searching, sorting or resizing while on page four almost always means the
//! viewer wants to see the top of the new result, not row 76 of it - and on a
//! shorter result there may be no page four to stay on. [`GridState`] therefore
//! resets the page itself rather than leaving each control to remember, which
//! is the kind of thing exactly one control always forgets.
