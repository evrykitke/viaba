//! Things a grid can do: to one row, or to the list as a whole.
//!
//! # Gating is declared, not remembered
//!
//! Every action carries the permission it needs. The grid hides the ones the
//! viewer does not hold - not disables, hides: a greyed-out "Delete" tells
//! someone what they are missing and gives them nothing to do about it.
//!
//! This is presentation, and it is the weaker half of the pair. **The server
//! decides.** `Caller::require` in the service is what actually refuses the
//! request; hiding a button only stops it being clicked by accident. An action
//! whose `require` is wrong is an untidy screen, and an action whose service is
//! ungated is a hole - so a new action starts at the service and works
//! outwards.
//!
//! # Two kinds, because a link is not a click
//!
//! [`ActionKind::Link`] renders an `<A>`: it can be middle-clicked, copied,
//! opened in a tab, and the router handles it. [`ActionKind::Run`] renders a
//! `<button>` and calls back with the row. Anything that changes data is a
//! `Run`; anything that goes somewhere is a `Link`. A `Run` that navigates and
//! a `Link` that mutates are both bugs.
//!
//! # Clicking the row
//!
//! [`RowAction::on_row_click`] marks one link as the thing a click anywhere on
//! the row does. It is a property of the *action*, not of the grid, so that
//! there is only ever one destination written down: a `row_href` on the
//! configuration beside an Open action pointing at the same page is two copies
//! of one URL, and the day they disagree the row and its menu go to different
//! screens.
//!
//! The action stays in the menu. The click is a shortcut to it and never a
//! replacement for it - which is also the whole of the keyboard story, because
//! a `<tr>` is not focusable and giving it `tabindex` would announce a second
//! link to a screen reader that already has the real one two cells along.
//!
//! Only a [`Link`](ActionKind::Link) may take it. A row that deleted itself
//! when somebody clicked it to read it would be indefensible, and
//! [`GridConfig::action`](super::config::GridConfig::action) refuses the
//! combination in debug builds rather than leaving it to be found.
