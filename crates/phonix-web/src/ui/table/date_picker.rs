//!
//! # Three ways in, one thing chosen
//!
//! A name, a pair of clicks on the calendar, or two typed dates. All three
//! write the same thing - two instants, in [`GridState::set_range`] - and the
//! panel reads that back to decide what to show. There is no "which control was
//! used last" to keep straight, and no pressed button left lit over a range
//! that has since been edited underneath it: the name is *derived*, by asking
//! which preset resolves to exactly the span in force.
//!
//! # The calendar takes two clicks and sends one request
//!
//! The first click is an anchor and goes nowhere near the state. Committing it
//! would put a one-day range on the wire that nobody asked for, and the second
//! click would then have to be drawn over its answer. So the anchor lives in a
//! signal here, the panel marks it, and the request is made when the span has
//! both ends. Clicking the earlier day second is the same span - a calendar is
//! read in whichever direction the eye goes.
//!
//! # It never renders on the server
//!
//! The panel exists only while it is open, and it opens on a click, so its
//! markup is only ever built in a browser. That is what makes it safe for it to
//! know what day it is: a component that reads the clock while rendering
//! produces different markup on the server and in the browser, and a hydration
//! mismatch in a wasm bundle is a dead page rather than a warning.
//!
//! The button outside it is rendered on both sides, and says "Any time" on
//! both: a grid opens unnarrowed, so there is no range to format and no clock
//! to read until somebody has already pressed something.
//!
//! # Read the clock, do not remember it
//!
//! `today` is fetched where it is needed rather than captured when the control
//! is built. A list screen is left open across a lunch break and across
//! midnight; a "Today" resolved when the page loaded would quietly mean
//! yesterday by the time it is pressed.
