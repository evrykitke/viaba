//! Drawing the alerts: the toast stack, the message box, the confirmation.
//!
//! # One layer, mounted once
//!
//! [`AlertLayer`] sits at the root of the application, above the router, for
//! two reasons. A toast raised by a save that then navigates has to outlive the
//! page that raised it - mounted inside a route, it would be unmounted by its
//! own success. And a dialog rendered inside the page is inside the page's
//! stacking context, where the sidebar or a sticky table header can be painted
//! over it.
//!
//! # Nothing is rendered until something is posted
//!
//! Every surface here is empty on the server and empty in the browser on the
//! first frame, which is what makes the layer hydration-safe: the server cannot
//! post an alert, so both halves agree on nothing. See
//! `[[hashed-bundles-prevent-stale-hydration]]` for what disagreeing costs.
//!
//! # Fixed overlays and the phone viewport
//!
//! Everything here is `position: fixed`, and a fixed overlay is only where you
//! put it while the viewport is the width of the device. Anything inside these
//! cards that cannot shrink - a long unbroken word, a wide table - would widen
//! the page and carry the toast off the side of a phone. Hence
//! `w-[min(22rem,100%)]` rather than a fixed width, and `break-words` on the
//! message: an alert usually carries a sentence from the server, which is not
//! text this file has seen.
