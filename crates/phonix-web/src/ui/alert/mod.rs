//! Alerts: the four ways this application tells somebody what happened.
//!
//! # Why this is one module and not four components
//!
//! Every screen eventually has to say "that worked", "that did not work" or
//! "are you sure?". Written per screen those come out as a `window.confirm`
//! here, a coloured `<div>` there, and a message that never appears at all on
//! the third - because the person had already scrolled past the place it was
//! rendered. The words are the screen's business; *where they appear and what
//! they look like* is not, and that is what lives here.
//!
//! # The four surfaces
//!
//! | Surface | Interrupts? | For |
//! | ------- | ----------- | --- |
//! | [`Channel::Toast`] | no | the default outcome of a form action |
//! | [`Channel::MessageBox`] | yes, one button | an outcome that must be read |
//! | [`Channel::Inline`] | no | a short form, where the message fits beside it |
//! | [`Confirm`] | yes, two buttons | *before* something that cannot be undone |
//!
//! The first three are the same value - an [`Alert`] - posted down a different
//! [`Channel`]. That is deliberate: a screen changes its mind about how loud a
//! message should be far more often than about what the message says, and this
//! way that change is one word.
//!
//! [`Confirm`] is the odd one out, and stays a separate type, because it is the
//! only one that asks a question rather than reporting an answer. It carries a
//! callback and has no tone-only variant: everything else here happens *after*
//! the deed.
//!
//! # Choosing a channel
//!
//! **Toast is the default for a form action.** By the time a save comes back
//! the person is usually looking somewhere else - at the next field, at the
//! tab they switched to - and a line rendered at the top of a form they have
//! scrolled past is a line nobody reads.
//!
//! **A message box when the outcome has to be acknowledged.** It costs a click,
//! which is the point: use it where carrying on without having read the result
//! would be a mistake, not merely untidy.
//!
//! **Inline for a short form**, where the whole form is on screen at once and a
//! toast in the corner is further from the person's eyes than the button they
//! just pressed.
//!
//! # One vocabulary
//!
//! Every surface draws itself from [`Tone::face`] - the same icon, the same
//! green, the same red, the same treatment of a border. Success and failure are
//! *not* different components: a save that fails posts the same shape of alert
//! as one that succeeds, down the same channel, so a screen cannot accidentally
//! offer a good outcome a home and leave a bad one with nowhere to go.
//!
//! # Posting one
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // From an action's chain, which is the usual way - see `ui::form::action`.
//! FormAction::submit("Save changes")
//!     .then(Then::Say("Role saved."))            // the form's own channel
//!     .then(Then::Alert(Alert::success("Role saved.").message_box()))
//!
//! // By hand, from anything that is not a form.
//! Alerts::get().post(Alert::failure(err.to_string()).message_box());
//! ```
