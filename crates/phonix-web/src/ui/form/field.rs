//! What a field is: an identifier, a label, a control, and two closures.
//!
//! # One field, one pair of closures
//!
//! A column declares one function, row to [`Cell`]. A field declares two,
//! because a form reads *and* writes:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Field::text("first_name", "First name", |u: &UserEdit| FieldValue::text(&u.first_name))
//!     .writing(|u, value| u.first_name = value.as_input())
//!     .required()
//! ```
//!
//! The conversion in both directions belongs to the field, which is what lets
//! the draft stay a typed struct while the control between the person and it
//! only ever handles strings and booleans.
//!
//! # `field` is the same identifier the grid uses
//!
//! Deliberately. A [`FieldError`] returned by the server names a field, and the
//! form places the message by matching that name - so the service, the form and
//! the column all have to agree on one spelling. Sharing the identifier is also
//! what lets a test assert that every field of a form names a real column of
//! the entity, which is the cheap way to catch a rename that only went halfway.
//!
//! # A field the viewer may not edit is shown, not hidden
//!
//! [`Field::require`] makes a field read-only rather than removing it. This is
//! the opposite of the rule for actions, and for a specific reason: a hidden
//! action is a button nobody presses, while a hidden *field* still gets
//! submitted (as whatever the draft was initialised with, or as nothing at
//! all) and quietly overwrites a value the viewer was not allowed to see.
//! Showing it disabled says "this exists, and it is not yours to change".
//!
//! [`Cell`]: crate::ui::table::Cell
//! [`FieldError`]: phonix_core::identity::validation::FieldError
