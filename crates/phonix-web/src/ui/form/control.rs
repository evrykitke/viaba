//! Drawing one field: its label, its control, its message.
//!
//! # Every control is wired the same way
//!
//! Whatever the kind, a control reads its value out of the draft and writes it
//! back through the field's own writer. Nothing here knows what a `UserStatus`
//! is; it moves a [`FieldValue`] in one direction and back.
//!
//! # The accessibility wiring is here so it cannot be forgotten
//!
//! A label bound to the control by `for`/`id`, `aria-describedby` pointing at
//! the help text and the error, `aria-invalid` when there is a message, and
//! `aria-required`. Written once here, every field of every form in the
//! application has it; written per screen, roughly none of them would.
//!
//! # A lookup is wired in both directions, and it has to be
//!
//! Every other control reports a string, and the draft is the only thing
//! holding state. A [`LookupField`] owns a signal of its own, because what it
//! holds is records with labels attached and the draft cannot always supply
//! those from a value alone. So the two are kept in step by a pair of effects
//! rather than one.
//!
//! The pair is *necessary*: a one-way binding from the field into the draft
//! looks correct until somebody presses Cancel - [`FormState::reset`] replaces
//! the draft wholesale, and a field that was not listening would go on showing
//! the record the form was reset out of.
//!
//! It is also the one place in this file that can hang the browser, so both
//! halves are worth stating exactly. Two rules, and the first version of this
//! broke both of them:
//!
//! **The write-back must not read the draft reactively.** It writes the draft,
//! and `RwSignal::update` notifies whether or not the value changed - so an
//! effect that both subscribes to the draft and writes it re-runs itself for
//! ever. It reads through [`FormState::held`], which does not track.
//!
//! **The two sides must be able to agree.** They are compared by value and
//! label, not by whole [`Choice`], because a `Choice` may carry a `detail` line
//! that the picker attached and the draft has nowhere to store: rebuilt from
//! the draft it comes back as `None`, so full equality would never once hold
//! and the pair would write at each other for ever. Comparing what the draft
//! can actually round-trip is what makes the fixpoint reachable.
