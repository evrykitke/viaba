//! Which control a field draws.
//!
//! Deliberately a small, closed set. Every entry here is one more thing the
//! renderer has to draw, label, disable and report errors on consistently, so
//! a kind earns its place by being needed by a screen rather than by being
//! conceivable.
//!
//! Notice what is *not* a kind: "required", "read-only", "full width" and
//! "which permission" are all properties of the [`Field`](super::Field), not of
//! the control. A required email and an optional one are the same control asked
//! a different question, and folding that into the kind would double the set
//! every time a new question was asked of a field.
//!
//! # Why this is not `PartialEq`
//!
//! It was, until [`FieldKind::Lookup`] arrived. A lookup's picker is an erased
//! closure - see [`Choices`] - and the only equality a closure can offer is
//! pointer identity, which reports two identically-built configurations as
//! different every time a screen re-renders. Rather than answer dishonestly,
//! the derive was dropped: nothing outside this file ever compared two kinds,
//! and what the form actually compares for dirtiness is the *draft*, which is
//! `PartialEq` for real.
//!
//! `Debug` survived, because it can be answered honestly - a closure prints as
//! a closure and everything around it prints as itself.
