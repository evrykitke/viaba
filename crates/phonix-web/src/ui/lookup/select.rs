//! A dropdown over a closed set of values.
//!
//! # Why this exists next to `LookupField`
//!
//! A [`LookupField`](super::LookupField) picks a *record*: it holds a `Choice`
//! because it has to draw a label for something a table handed it, it can
//! create what is missing, and it can show two columns. A select picks a
//! *value* out of a list somebody wrote down - a theme, a reset period, a page
//! size, a currency code. It answers with a `String` and it never creates
//! anything.
//!
//! They are the same family and share the same panel: the arithmetic that puts
//! it on the screen is in [`place`](super::place), the four ways it goes away
//! are in [`panel`](super::panel). Only the field differs, and it differs
//! enough to be worth its own component - chips and a text box are the wrong
//! shape for a control that sits in a toolbar at `h-8`.
//!
//! # Why not the browser's `<select>`
//!
//! Because it is not ours. A native dropdown is drawn by the operating system:
//! it does not take the app's theme, which on a dark page means a white menu;
//! it does not take the app's type or spacing; it cannot put a line of
//! explanation under an option; and it looks different on every platform the
//! app is used on. The one thing it does better is being a control the
//! platform already knows, and that is what `role="listbox"`, the arrow keys,
//! Enter, Escape and a real `<button>` are here to buy back.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! <SelectField
//!     value=Signal::derive(move || period.get().as_str().to_owned())
//!     on_change=Callback::new(move |value: String| period.set(parse(&value)))
//!     options=vec![Choice::new("never", "Never"), Choice::new("yearly", "Yearly")]
//! />
//! ```
//!
//! # Every reactive read is guarded, this module's own signals included
//!
//! A select is drawn inside grid rows and inside the grid's pager, and a
//! `Transition` disposes the owner of what is on screen the moment the table
//! starts reloading. The markup stays: old rows are what a transition shows
//! while the new page is on its way, so every attribute closure hanging off
//! them is a live subscriber to signals that have already gone.
//!
//! Two things reach into that window. The obvious one is the signals a
//! *caller* hands in - `value`, `disabled`, `invalid` belong to the grid and
//! outlive the disposal, so they go on notifying subscribers allocated in the
//! owner that has just gone.
//!
//! The other is this module's own signals, which is the one that is easy to
//! argue yourself out of: `open` is disposed alongside everything that reads
//! it, so surely it can never be read late. It can, because marking an effect
//! dirty and running it are not the same tick. `take` closes the panel and
//! tells the caller in the same handler, and whichever order those go in, one
//! of them queues the field's class effect while the arena is alive and the
//! other disposes that arena before the queue is flushed. The effect then
//! runs against an `open` that no longer exists. That is what a page size
//! chosen in a grid panicked on, at the last bare `open.get()` in this file.
//!
//! So: **`try_*` every reactive read a view closure can re-run, and derive
//! nothing.** A `Signal::derive` and a `StoredValue` are arena values too - a
//! plain closure over `Copy` captures answers the same question and owns
//! nothing that can be disposed, which is why `chosen` and `matching` are
//! closures and why the option rows compare two strings instead of sharing a
//! memo. A select whose owner has gone reads as nothing chosen, shows an
//! empty list and drops its border colour, and all of that is honest: it is a
//! picture of a control that is about to be replaced.
