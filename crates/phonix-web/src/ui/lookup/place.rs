//! Where a lookup's panel sits.
//!
//! "Wherever the field is" is the whole requirement, and it is less trivial
//! than it sounds because a field near the bottom of a long form has no room
//! below it and a field near the right edge has no room beside it. So the
//! panel is measured from the trigger when it opens and clamped into the
//! viewport, exactly as the grid's row menu is - and for the same underlying
//! reason.
//!
//! # Fixed, not absolute
//!
//! A lookup can be inside a form inside a panel inside the shell's scrolling
//! content column, and it can be inside a table cell inside `overflow-x-auto`.
//! An absolutely positioned panel is clipped by the first of those ancestors
//! that scrolls, which shows up as a dropdown that opens and is cut in half.
//! `position: fixed` takes it out of all of them, at the price of not
//! travelling with the page - so anything that would move it closes it
//! instead. See the listeners in [`super`].
