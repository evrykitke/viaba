//! Lookups: a field whose choices are another entity.
//!
//! A `<select>` is the right control for a closed set somebody wrote down
//! once: a status, a tone of voice. It is the wrong one the moment the options
//! are *records*. It cannot be searched, it cannot show two columns, it cannot
//! say that the value you are looking for does not exist yet, and on a list of
//! six hundred currencies it is unusable.
//!
//! # Two presentations, one component
//!
//! * [`Choices::List`] - a filtering list. For a lookup you can identify from
//!   its name: a unit of measure, a category, a currency.
//! * [`Choices::Table`] - a grid in the panel. For a lookup you cannot: a
//!   supplier you know by code and region, an item you pick by stock level.
//!
//! The table presentation is a real [`DataGrid`](crate::ui::table::DataGrid)
//! over the entity's own `GridConfig` in
//! [`choosing`](crate::ui::table::GridConfig::choosing) mode, not a second
//! table that happens to look like one. That is the whole reason it is worth
//! building: search, paging, sorting, column choice and the one description of
//! what the entity *is* all arrive with it, and the picker cannot drift from
//! the list screen because it is the list screen.
//!
//! # Quick add, and the seam that keeps it out of the kit
//!
//! Discovering a missing value halfway through a form must not cost the form.
//! Navigating away to add a currency and coming back means retyping
//! everything, so [`QuickAdd::Form`] puts a small form in a dialog over the
//! field: it creates the record, selects it, and closes. [`QuickAdd::Page`] is
//! the fallback for an entity too big for that - it is a link, and it is
//! honest about leaving.
//!
//! Both of those, and the table picker, are the same shape:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! type Picker = Arc<dyn Fn(Callback<Choice>) -> AnyView + Send + Sync>;
//! ```
//!
//! *Something* that renders and eventually calls back with a choice. This is
//! deliberate type erasure, and it is what stops the lookup becoming generic
//! over the entity being looked up. A `Lookup<T>` would have to be generic over
//! the picked entity, and a quick-add would make it generic over that entity's
//! *draft* type as well - which is two type parameters on a field, spreading to
//! every form that holds one. The entity supplies a closure; the lookup wires
//! the answer; neither knows the other's types.
//!
//! # One or many
//!
//! The value is a `Vec<Choice>` in both cases, with [`multiple`] deciding
//! whether choosing replaces or toggles. A separate multi-select component
//! would be this file again with two lines changed - the filtering, the
//! keyboard, the panel placement, the quick add and the two presentations are
//! all the same - and the two would drift.
//!
//! [`multiple`]: LookupField
//!
//! # Everything is closed by anything that would move it
//!
//! The panel is `position: fixed`, for the reason set out in [`place`]. Fixed
//! means it does not travel with the page, so a scroll, a wheel, a resize or a
//! pointer anywhere else closes it rather than leaving it stranded beside the
//! field it used to belong to.
//!
//! # Every reactive read here is guarded
//!
//! A lookup is drawn inside grid rows, and a `Transition` disposes the owner
//! of what is on screen while leaving the markup up. Every closure in this
//! file can therefore be re-run after the signals it reads have gone - the
//! ones a caller handed in, and this component's own, which is the half that
//! is easy to argue yourself out of. The whole argument is written out once,
//! in [`select`](select), and it applies here line for line.
