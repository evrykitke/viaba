//! Drawing the app catalog.
//!
//! [`phonix_core::apps`] describes what a workspace can switch on. It names its
//! icon as a Lucide string rather than an [`Icon`], because `Icon` is three
//! hundred variants of SVG geometry that live in this crate, which sits above
//! `phonix-core`. This is the one place the string becomes a drawing.
//!
//! The table is small on purpose - one line per app - and the test below fails
//! the build if an app names an icon that has not been through
//! `tools/icons.txt`. So the declaration stays with the app and the resolution
//! stays with the drawings, and neither can drift without something going red.

/// The same shape as [`crate::ui::viewer::Viewer`] and for the same reason: the
/// launcher, the dashboard's opening card and the permission editor all need
/// this list, and three components each opening their own resource would be
/// three round trips for one constant-sized answer.
///
/// # `None` means "not yet", and it is not the same as "nothing"

/// An empty list is a real answer - a workspace with only core. Unresolved has
/// to be told apart from it, because the two want opposite defaults: a
/// permission editor that treated "not yet" as "nothing" would draw a third of
/// its tree, then grow. Where the difference matters, `None` should mean *show
/// everything* and let the answer narrow it, which is the way round that never
/// hides a control somebody was reaching for.
