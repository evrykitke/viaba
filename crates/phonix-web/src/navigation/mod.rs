//! The navigation tree: what the sidebar and the command palette both read.
//!
//! # One declaration, three consumers
//!
//! The menu is declared once, in [`tree`], and three separate things read it:
//! the sidebar draws it, the command palette searches it, and the breadcrumb
//! names the current place. Adding a screen is a node in that one list - not an
//! entry in a sidebar array, another in a search index, and a third in a
//! breadcrumb map that will drift apart within a month.
//!
//! # Permissions
//!
//! Every node may name a permission from [`phonix_core::authorization`]. A node
//! whose permission the viewer does not hold is not rendered - and neither is a
//! group left with nothing inside it, which is what stops an empty
//! "Administration" heading from advertising a section nobody can open.
//!
//! This is presentation, not enforcement. Hiding a link stops it being offered;
//! it does not stop it being typed. The server function behind the screen states
//! its own permission through `phonix_services::Caller::require`, and that is
//! the check that matters. The two read the same constants so they cannot
//! disagree about the name.
//!
//! # Active state
//!
//! Menus are trees, so "which item is selected" is really "which *path* through
//! the tree is selected". [`Trail`] answers that once per navigation: the
//! deepest node whose route matches the URL, plus every ancestor. The sidebar
//! highlights the last entry, marks the rest as ancestors, and expands the
//! groups among them - so opening a child route opens its parents for free, at
//! any depth, without a single screen knowing it has to.
