//! The Phonix Leptos application.
//!
//! Compiled twice:
//!
//! * with `--features ssr`     for the server binary (`phonix-server`)
//! * with `--features hydrate` for the WebAssembly bundle
//!
//! Code that must not reach the browser - database access, secrets, broker
//! connections - lives behind `#[cfg(feature = "ssr")]` or inside a `#[server]`
//! function body, which the macro strips from the client build.

// Leptos view types are one deeply nested tuple per screen, and the compiler
// computes their layout recursively. The sign-up form alone exceeds the default
// 128; this is the type checker's stack, not ours, and costs nothing to raise.
#![recursion_limit = "512"]
// A panic here is not an error, it is the end of the session: in wasm the
// strategy is abort, so one panic stops every handler, effect and resource in
// the module at once and the page freezes. `recovery` makes that survivable;
// this makes it rare. The crate is already compliant - one documented
// `expect`, on `Shell::get` - and the point of the deny is that it stays that
// way rather than drifting back one convenient `unwrap` at a time.

// test` builds it. A test that unwraps is a test that fails loudly on the
// developer's machine, which is exactly what it should do.
