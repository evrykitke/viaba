//! Which language this page is in, and how a view asks for words.
//!
//! # `l!` is `msg!` already resolved
//!
//! ```ignore
//! <h1>{l!("auth.signin.title")}</h1>
//! <p>{l!("validation.password.too_short", min = 12)}</p>
//! ```
//!
//! The key is checked at compile time by [`phonix_core::msg`], which this wraps.
//! A view wants words now, so `l!` returns a `String`; a validator wants to
//! defer, so it returns a [`Message`] and the view resolves it later with
//! [`t`].
//!
//! # The server decides, and the browser is told
//!
//! Language resolution happens once, on the server, before a byte of HTML is
//! written. The choice is stamped on `<html lang>` and the catalog that produced
//! it is inlined into the document. Hydration then reads **both back off the
//! DOM** rather than working them out again.
//!
//! That is not laziness - it is the only arrangement that is safe. Leptos
//! compares the DOM the wasm builds against the DOM the server sent, and a
//! single differing word is a hydration mismatch. A mismatch in this
//! application is not a warning: wasm aborts rather than unwinds, so the page
//! freezes. Two independent resolutions can differ; reading the server's answer
//! cannot.
//!
//! # Why the whole catalog is inlined, and why that is cheaper than it looks
//!
//! Only the *overlay* is inlined - the deployment file's contents. The built-in
//! English is already inside the wasm bundle, so sending it again would be
//! sending the same bytes to a browser that has them. An English page therefore
//! inlines `{}`.
//!
//! A translated page inlines its whole catalog, tens of kilobytes before
//! compression. The alternative - fetching `/i18n/fr.<hash>.json` and letting
//! the browser cache it forever - is genuinely cheaper per page and is the
//! right next step, but it cannot serve the first frame: hydration would have
//! to wait for a network round trip, and until it landed the wasm would have
//! only English to render, which is the mismatch again. Inline first, cache the
//! second visit.
//!
//! # Changing language reloads the page
//!
//! The switcher writes a cookie and reloads rather than swapping strings in
//! place. The server has to re-render anyway - `<html lang>`, the `dir`
//! attribute, and every string resolved during SSR are all the old language -
//! and a reload makes the new language true everywhere at once instead of
//! true in the parts that happened to be reactive.
//!
//! It also means [`Locale`] holds a plain catalog rather than a signal, and no
//! view has to be reactive over its own wording.
