//! Master data: the parties this workspace trades with, and its taxes.
//!
//! Thin, like every other file here: each one parses its input, calls **one**
//! use case, and maps the result. The permission is stated inside the service,
//! not here - a second check in this file would be a second place to forget,
//! and the first one is the one that runs whether the request came from this
//! page, a script, or a future API.
//!
//! # Why `list_parties` takes a role
//!
//! So that an app can ask for its own without knowing about anybody else's.
//! Books asks for `customer`; the master-data screen passes `None` and gets
//! them all. The alternative - a `list_customers` endpoint - would put Books'
//! vocabulary in `master`, which is the direction the whole boundary exists to
//! prevent.
