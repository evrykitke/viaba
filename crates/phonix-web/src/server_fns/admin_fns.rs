//! The people in this workspace, the roles, and what each may do.

//! # The editor submits a set, not a diff

//! Both save endpoints take the whole ticked set. A diff computed in the
//! browser would be a diff against whatever that tab loaded, which may be
//! somebody else's screen from ten minutes ago - and applying it would silently
//! undo their change. Working the difference out server-side, from what is
//! stored now, makes two administrators saving the same screen idempotent
//! rather than a race.
//!
//! Every one of these states its permission inside the service it calls. There
//! is no check here, deliberately: a second one in this file would be a second
//! place to forget, and the first one is the one that runs whether the request
//! came from this page, a script, or a future API.
