//! The credentials that let other software reach this workspace.
//!
//! Four endpoints for one screen: list the keys, mint one, stop one, and turn
//! the whole surface on or off for this workspace.
//!
//! # Nothing here decides anything
//!
//! Which is worth saying twice for this file in particular, because it is about
//! credentials. `phonix_services::identity::api_key` mints the token, refuses a
//! scope the issuer does not hold, and records the audit row; the licence is
//! `Settings`, checked in the same place. These functions parse, call one use
//! case, and map the result - and the public API answers to the same use cases,
//! so a check written here rather than there would protect one adapter and not
//! the other.
//!
//! # The token exists for exactly one response
//!
//! [`issue_api_key`] is the only endpoint in the application that returns a
//! usable credential, and it returns it once. Nothing stores it, no other
//! endpoint can produce it, and [`list_api_keys`] carries a four-character hint
//! instead - so a screen that redraws after a refresh cannot show it again.
