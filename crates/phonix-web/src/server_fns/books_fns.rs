//! Sales invoices.
//!
//! # There is no endpoint that prices an invoice
//!
//! Deliberately. The browser prices it locally with `app_books::pricing`, which
//! is the same code the server posts with - that is the whole reason the crate
//! compiles to wasm. A "calculate totals" round trip would be a second
//! implementation of the arithmetic living in the network, and the first thing
//! to disagree with the document.
//!
//! What the browser does need is the resolved tax treatments, which depend on
//! the document's date and on a rate table it cannot see. [`tax_treatments`]
//! hands them over once, and everything after that is local.
