//! A sales invoice: what it holds, and what state it is in.
//!
//! # Three states, and only one of them can be edited
//!
//! A [`InvoiceStatus::Draft`] has no number and is freely editable.
//! [`InvoiceStatus::Posted`] is the document: numbered, snapshotted, and
//! frozen. [`InvoiceStatus::Voided`] is a posted invoice withdrawn - it keeps
//! its number, because a number that disappears is a gap, and a gap is what an
//! auditor asks about.
//!
//! There is deliberately no path from posted back to draft. An invoice that can
//! be edited after it has been sent is not evidence of anything; a mistake is
//! corrected by voiding it and raising another.
//!
//! # The snapshot is the record
//!
//! [`PartySnapshot`] and the per-line tax detail are copied onto the invoice
//! when it is posted and never re-resolved. A customer who moves, a tax that
//! changes and a rate that drifts must not rewrite a document that was already
//! sent.
